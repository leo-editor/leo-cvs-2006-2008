# The main distribution script executes this file as follows:
# 
#     'python createLeoDist.py sdist <args>'
# 
# to create Leo's main distribution file, leo-nn.zip.
# 
# N.B. This file is distributed in the dist directory, but it must be run from 
# the
# leo directory, so the main distribution script copies the file (temporarily) 
# to
# the leo directory before running the command above.
