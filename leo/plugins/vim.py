'''A plugin that communicates with VIM.

Important: the open_with plugin must be enabled for this plugin to work properly.

When properly installed, this plugin does the following:
    
- Double clickin on a node's icon opens that node in VIM. You can open nodes in
VIM with a single-click if you set useDoubleClick = False. However, that
interfere's with Leo's dragging logic.

- Leo will update the node in the outline when you save the file in VIM.

To install this plugin do the following:
    
1. Set the vim_cmd and vim_exe settings to the path to vim or gvim as shown in leoSettings.leo.

2. If you are using Python 2.4 or above, that's all you need to do. Jim
Sizelove's new code will start vim automatically using Python's subprocess
module. The subprocess module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems,
Leo will use subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

On Windows, you can install Python's subprocess module in Python 2.2 or 2.3 as follows:
    
    - Go to http://www.effbot.org/downloads/#subprocess

    - Download and execute one of the following installers, depending on your verions of Python:
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.3.exe 
        subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.2.exe
        
This installer installs the subprocess sources and also _subprocess.pyd in Python's site-packages folder.
        
3. If you **don't** have Python's subprocess module available you must start the vim server in one of two ways:
            
- **Manually**, from a console::
    
    vim --servername "LEO" # The name of the server *must* be LEO.

- **Automatically**, when Leo starts up.  Uncomment the following line in the init function::
    
    os.system(_vim_cmd) # Don't do this if using Python 2.4 or above!

# 
# 1.5 EKR:
#     - Added new sections.
#     - Move most comments into docstring.
#     - Added useDoubleClick variable.
#     - Added init function.
#     - Init _vim_cmd depending on sys.platform.
# 
# 1.6 EKR:
#     - Use keywords to get c, not g.top().
#     - Don't use during unit testing: prefer xemacs instead.
#     - Added _vim_exe
#     - Use "os.spawnv" instead of os.system.
#     - Simplified the search of g.app.openWithFiles.
#     - Fixed bug in open_in_vim: hanged v.bodyString to v.bodyString()
# 
# 1.7 EKR:
#     - Excellent new code by Jim Sizelove solves weird message on first open 
# of vim.
# 1.8 EKR:
#     - Set subprocess = None if import fails.
# 1.9 EKR:
#     - Document how install subproces, and use g.importExtension to import 
# subprocess.
#     - Import subprocess with g.importExtension.
# 1.10 EKR:
#     - Support 'vim_cmd' and 'vim_exe' settings.
#     - These override the default _vim_cmd and _vim_exe settings.
# 1.11 EKR:
#     - Emergency default for window is now the default location: c:\Program 
# Files\vim\vim63
# 1.12 EKR:
#     - Added emergency default for 'darwin'.
#     - Corrected the call to openWith.  It must now use data=data due to a 
# new event param.
# 1.13 EKR:
# - The docstring now states that the open_with plugin must be enabled for 
# this to work.

# I was trying to get Leo to work more effectively with Vim, my editor of 
# choice.
# To do so, I made several changes to Leo which (I believe) make it work 
# better.
# 
# After much exploring and trying various things, I made a change to the 
# os.spawnv
# section of the openWith function in leoCommands.py. This added line seems to
# prevent the "weird error message on first open of Vim." (vim.py, line 32) 
# when
# opening Vim with os.spawnv.
# 
# os.spawnv needs the command it is calling as the first argument in the args 
# list
# in addition, so the command actually shows twice in the total args to 
# os.spawnv,
# e.g.::
#     os.spawnv(os.P_NOWAIT, "C:/Program Files/Vim/vim63/gvim.exe",
#         ["gvim.exe", "--servername", "LEO", "--remote", "foo.txt"])
# If the call is made without the command-name as the first item in the list 
# of
# args, like so::
#     os.spawnv(os.P_NOWAIT, "C:/Program Files/Vim/vim63/gvim.exe",
#         ["--servername", "LEO", "--remote", "foo.txt"])
# 
# an error message pops up::
#     E247: no registered server named "GVIM": Send failed.  Trying to execute 
# locally
# This message means that gVim is not looking for a server named "LEO", which
# presumably the user has already opened with the command "gvim --servername 
# LEO".
# Instead it is looking for a server named "GVIM", and not finding it, opens 
# the
# files "foo.txt" and "LEO" (notice that it didn't catch the "--servername"
# argument and thinks that "LEO" is the name of a new file to create) in two
# buffers in a local copy of gVim. Now, if the command is::
# 
#     os.spawnv(
#         os.P_NOWAIT, "C:/Program Files/Vim/vim63/gvim.exe",
#         ["gvim.exe", "--servername", "LEO", "--remote", "foo.txt"])
# 
# everything works great, as long as the user doesn't close the gVim window. 
# If
# the user has closed the gVim window, then tries to open a node in Vim, they 
# will
# see this error message::
# 
#     E247: no registered server named "LEO": Send failed.
# 
# Trying to execute locally If you use the "--remote-silent" argument, gVim 
# will
# start the LEO server without the error message.
# 
# One other comment:  you can see which servers gVim has running by typing::
# 
#     vim --serverlist
# 
# at the command prompt.
# 
# The rest of my changes have to do with using the subprocess module instead 
# of
# the os.system, and various os.spawn* calls. I find subprocess easier to
# understand, and it is fairly simple to use for the most common kinds of 
# process
# calls, but is capable of all the variations you may need. It is designed to
# replace all the os.system, os.spawn*, and popen* calls. It is available in
# Python 2.4.
# 
# So I added some lines to use subprocess in the OpenWith plugin and the Vim 
# plugin.
# 
# I also have added a table in the "create_open_with_menu" function that makes 
# use of the various editors I have used at times.  Most of those editors are 
# called with subprocess.Popen.
