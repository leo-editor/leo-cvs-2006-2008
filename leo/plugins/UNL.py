'''This plugin supports Uniform Node Locators (UNL's). UNL's specify nodes within
Leo files. UNL's are not limited to nodes within the present Leo file; you can
use them to create cross-Leo-file links! UNL

This plugin consists of two parts:

1) Selecting a node shows the UNL in the status line at the bottom of the Leo
   window. You can copy from the status line and paste it into headlines, emails,
   whatever. 

2) Double-clicking @url nodes containing UNL's select the node specified in the
   UNL. If the UNL species in another Leo file, the other file will be opened.

Format of UNL's:

UNL's referring to nodes within the present outline have the form::

    headline1-->headline2-->...-->headlineN

headline1 is the headline of a top-level node, and each successive headline is
the headline of a child node.

UNL's of the form::

    file:<path>#headline1-->...-->headlineN

refer to a node specified in <path> For example, double clicking the following
headline will take you to Chapter 8 of Leo's Users Guide::

    @url file:c:/prog/leoCvs/leo/doc/leoDocs.leo#Users Guide-->Chapter 8: Customizing Leo
    
For example, suppose you want to email someone with comments about a Leo file.
Create a comments.leo file containing @url UNL nodes. That is, headlines are
@url followed by a UNL. The body text contains your comments about the nodes in
the _other_ Leo file! Send the comments.leo to your friend, who can use the
comments.leo file to quickly navigate to the various nodes you are talking
about. As another example, you can copy UNL's into emails. The recipient can
navigate to the nodes 'by hand' by following the arrows in the UNL.

**Notes**:

- At present, UNL's refer to nodes by their position in the outline. Moving a
  node will break the link.

- Don't refer to nodes that contain UNL's in the headline. Instead, refer to the
  parent or child of such nodes.

- You don't have to replace spaces in URL's or UNL's by '%20'.
