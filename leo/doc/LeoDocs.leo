<t tx="EKR.20040518070558">Leo 4.2 alpha 2           May 18, 2004

This is an important milestone in Leo's history; the two defining features of the 4.2 code base are complete:

1. This is the first stable version using the "shared nodes" code base.

Shared nodes dramatically improve the time needed to insert, delete, and move nodes.  Moreover, the new code base is code compatible with the old.  Indeed, much of Leo still uses the old code base.  See Chapter 7 for full details of how to script Leo with the 4.2 code base.

2. This is the first version to use @file-thin for most derived files.

@file-thin makes it possible to use Leo effectively in a cvs environment.  Indeed, cvs now contains only a "dummy" version of LeoPy.leo.  The idea is that:

- LeoPyRef.leo hardly ever changes.  Developers will download LeoPyRef.leo once from cvs, then rename LeoPyRef.leo to be LeoPy.leo.  LeoPy.leo is private to each developer.

- Developers will commit and update to cvs only thin derived files.  There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and the files derived from them "in synch".

- Similar remarks apply to LeoPlugins.leo.  Cvs contains only LeoPluginsRef.leo, and contributors will need only to submit thin derived files.

I have been using the new code base without incident for weeks now, and I am fairly confident that it is safe to use.  Nevertheless, I would suggest routine caution when dealing with this version until more people have tested it.

Known bugs

- Cutting and pasting an @file-thin node does not work properly.  This will be easy to fix, I think.

- The present algorithm for reading thin derived files probably does not handle properly the situation in which a named node is some kind of grand child of the referencing node rather than being an immediate child of the referencing node.  This is a rare situation, easily avoided, and it doesn't happen at all in LeoPy.leo.  Nevertheless, something must be done.

Other improvements:

- Fixed a number of problems with using Leo on MacOS X.  In particular, Leo now uses the clover key as is usual on the Mac.  More Mac and *nix specific improvements are coming.

Still to do:

- Perfect import and @import.
- Make the Go To Line Number command work with @file-thin files.
- Fix minor bugs and add new features
  See the "To Do: 4.2" node in the leoToDo.txt node in LeoPy.leo.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070824"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070824.1">- Moved call to assignFileIndices into write_Leo_file.
- Called assignFileIndices in writeAtFileNodes, writeDirtyAtFileNodes, writeMissingAtFileNodes</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940.5">What I did:

File format

Added -thin field to @+leo sentinel

Recognizers

- Added vnode recognizers for @file-thin option.
- Added position proxies for vnode recognizers.

Directives &amp; sentinels
- Added support for @all.

Writing

- Added top-level atFile code to write @file-thin tree.
- DO write @file-thin vnodes if there was an error writing the derived file.
	- No autosave for @file-thin.
 	- Leo writes @file nodes first, so this is not a problem.
	- putVnode checks orphan bit, which gets set if there was an error.
- Don't write vnodes (or related tnodes) for @file-thin trees. (fileCommands).
- Do write empty nodes in @thin trees.
- Don't generate close node sentinels until all children have been generated.

Reading

- Set at.thinFile when reading thin files.
- Suppressed changed message and related items for thin files.
- Modified scanText4 and allies to read thin derived files.
	- Don't look for tnodeList for thin files.
	- Initially, at.lastThinNode is at.root.v
	- readStartNode calls createThinChild
	- createThinChild makes a child of at.lastThinNode if needed and sets at.lastThinNode.
- Updated fc.tnodesDict in at.createThinChild.
	Otherwise clones existing only in two thin files won't be linked properly.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940.156">After a match, the find-next command searched only in the suboutline where the first match occurred.
To fix this, we call g.app.findFrame.handleUserClick in various Tk event handlers.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518070940.164">@nocolor


p.v.t.visitedBit was used for two purposes:

- To mark the nodes to be written.
- To mark nodes that are not orphan.

What I did:

- Added t.is/set/clearWriteBit.
- Call t.setWriteBit in putVnode unless we are in a thin node.
- putTnodes tests for t.writeBit rather than t.visitedBit.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518071415">Leo did not handle moving a node to the root position of the outline correctly.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040518075457">Using @ignore with @file-thin is asking for trouble.
If you remove the @ignore and then save, you will lose data.

How to recover the data:
	- Read Outline.
	- Remove @ignore
	- Import derived file... </t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.26"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.27">A cloned node is a copy of a node that changes when the original changes. Not
only are changes maintained across all the the clones of a node, changes to its
offspring (children, grandchildren, etc). are simultaneously made to the
corresponding offspring of all of those clones. A small red arrow in the icon
box marks cloned nodes. There is no real distinction between the "original" node
and any of its clones. This makes it possible to update any of the clones and
the original node will change as well. A cloned nodes becomes a regular node
again when its penultimate clone is deleted. Clones are useful for making
alternate views of a program. See `Clones and views`_ for full details.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.36">The ``Insert Node`` command inserts a new node into the outline. The
``Delete Node`` command deletes a node and all its children.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.37">The ``Cut Outline``, ``Paste Outline``, ``Copy Outline`` and ``Delete Outline``
commands work on nodes rather than text. For example, to delete a node,
select the node and choose the ``Cut Outline`` or ``Delete Outline``
command. The ``Cut Outline`` and ``Copy Outline`` commands copy a text
representation of the outline to the clipboard. This representation is the same
as Leo's .leo file format with some information deleted. You may copy this text
representation into a body pane (or into any other text editor) using the
``Edit:Paste`` command.

**Warning**: In practice, it is almost always wiser to move clones rather than
cutting or pasting them. Cutting and pasting outlines preserves clones, but the
links between clones only exist within the part of the outline that was pasted.
Therefore, if you are cutting and pasting an outline containing clones it is
best to cut and paste the *entire* outline. Alternatively, you can paste part of
an outline, then delete all clones.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.38">You may drag an node (including all its descendants) from one place to another
in an outline. To start a drag, press the main (left) mouse button while the
cursor is over the icon for a node. The cursor will change to a hand icon. If
you release the mouse button while the hand cursor is above the icon for another
node, Leo will move the dragged node after that node. If you release the mouse
button when the hand cursor is not over an icon, Leo will leave the outline pane
as it is. Leo scrolls the outline pane as the result of mouse-moved events, so
to continue scrolling you must keep moving the mouse.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.39">Leo auto indents unless ``@nocolor`` is in effect. Typing a newline
automatically inserts the same leading whitespace present on the previous line.
If Python is the present language, Leo inserts an additional tab if the previous
line ends with a colon.

The default features of Leo's body text derive from the Tk.Text widget,
described at: http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.3/TkCmd/text.htm Not all these features
are found on all platforms.
The following features are derived from the Tk Text widget. Some default
behaviors have been changed because they conflict with other Leo features.

-   Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before the character
    underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any
    selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse button 1 strokes out a selection
    between the insertion cursor and the character under the mouse. 
    
-   Double-clicking mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse and
    positions the insertion cursor at the end of the word.
    
-   The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1 while
    the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of the selection that was
    nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was pressed. 
    
-   Clicking mouse button 1 with the ``Control`` key down will reposition the insertion
    cursor without affecting the selection. 
    
-   Normal printing characters are inserted at the point of the insertion cursor. 
    
-   If the mouse is dragged out of the body pane while button 1 is pressed, the
    entry will automatically scroll to make more text visible.
    
-   ``Left Arrow`` and ``Right Arrow`` move the cursor one
    character to the left or right and clear any selection in the text.

-   ``Shift Left`` or ``Shift Right`` move the cursor and extend the selection.

-   ``Control-Left`` and ``Control-Right`` move the insertion cursor by words,
    and ``Control-Shift-Left`` and ``Control-Shift-Right`` move the insertion
    cursor by words and also extend the selection.
    
-   ``Up Arrow`` and ``Down Arrow`` move the insertion cursor one line up or down and
    clear any selection in the text. 

-   ``Shift Up`` and ``Shift Right`` move the cursor and extend the selection.

-   ``Control-Up`` and ``Control-Down`` move the insertion cursor by paragraphs.

-   ``Control-Shift-Up and ``Control-Shift-Down`` move the insertion cursor by
    paragraphs and extend the selection. ``Control-p`` and ``Control-n`` behave
    the same as ``Up`` and ``Down``, respectively. **Note**: by default, Leo
    binds ``Control-p`` and ``control-n`` to commands.
    
-   ``Next`` (``Page Down``) and ``Prior`` (``Page Up``) keys move the
    insertion cursor one screen and clear any text selection.

-   ``Shift Next`` and ``Shift Prior`` move the cursor one screen and extend the selection.
    
-   Line movement is by text lines terminated by hard returns (newlines), not by
    displayed lines; if a text line is long and wraps across more than one display
    line, then the ``Up`` and ``Down`` movement will skip the extra wrapped display lines.
    
-   ``Home`` moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of its line and clears any
    selection in the widget.

-   ``Shift-Home`` moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the line and extends the selection. 
    
-   ``End`` moves the insertion cursor to the end of the line and clear any selection in
    the widget.

-   ``Shift-End moves`` the cursor to the end of the line and extends the selection. 
    
-   ``Control-Home`` moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the text and clears
    any selection in the widget.

-   ``Control-Shift-Home`` moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the text and extends the selection. 
    
-   ``Control-End`` moves the insertion cursor to the end of the text and clears any
    selection.

-   ``Control-Shift-End`` moves the cursor to the end of the text and extends the selection. 
    
-   ``Select`` and ``Control-Space`` set the selection anchor to the position of the
    insertion cursor. They don't affect the current selection.

-   ``Shift-Select`` and ``Control-Shift-Space`` adjust the selection to the current position of the
    insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor to the insertion cursor if there was
    no previous selection. 
    
-   ``Control-/`` selects the entire contents of the widget. 
    
-   ``Control-\`` clears any selection in the widget. 
    
-   ``F16``  (``Copy`` on many Sun workstations) or ``Control-c`` copies the
    selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.
    
-   ``F20` (``Cut`` on many Sun workstations) or ``Control-x`` copies the
    selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the selection.
    These keys have no effect if no text is selected.
    
-   ``F18`` (``Paste`` on many Sun workstations) or ``Control-v`` inserts the
    contents of the clipboard at the position of the insertion cursor.
    
-   ``Delete`` deletes the text selection, or the character to the right of the cursor
    if there is no text selection.
    
-   ``Backspace`` deletes the selection, or character to the left of the cursor
    if there is no text selection.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.40">You can expand or contract a node by clicking in the standard Windows Tree
View icon to the left of the status icon. Expanding a node shows its immediate
children; contracting a node hides all its children. The ``Expand All Subheads``
command expands all of a nodes offspring (children, grandchildren, etc.)</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.41">Leo auto indents body text following colons when ``@language Python`` is in
effect. When the ``smart_auto_indent`` setting is True, Leo uses Emacs-style
auto-indentation instead. This style of auto-indent aligns newly created lines
with unmatched ``(`` ``[`` or ``{`` brackets in the previous line.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.43">You can mark nodes in several ways:

- With the ``Mark`` commands.

- With the ``Find`` or ``Change`` commands.

- With the ``Untangle`` command.

The ``Go To Next Marked`` command selects the next marked node, if any.
The ``Mark`` command unmarks the selected headline if it is already marked.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.44">The ``Move Up``, ``Move Down``, ``Move Left`` and ``Move Right`` commands move the currently
selected node. The ``Promote`` command makes all the children of a node
siblings of the node. The ``Demote`` command makes all following siblings of a
node children of the node.

You can cut and paste any part of a tree. If a node contains selected text,
the cut, copy, clear or paste operation affects only the selected text.
Otherwise, the cut, copy, clear or paste operations acts on the node and all
nodes contained by it. For example, you can move a node by cutting it,
selecting another location in the outline and pasting the node in the new
location.

**Warning**: In practice, it is almost always wiser to move clones rather than
cutting or pasting them. Cutting and pasting outlines preserves clones, but the
links between clones only exist within the part of the outline that was pasted.
Therefore, if you are cutting and pasting an outline containing clones it is
best to cut and paste the _entire_ outline. Alternatively, you can paste part of
an outline, then delete all clones. 
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.45">Double-clicking the icon box of a node whose headline has the form::

    @url &lt;any url&gt;

executes the url in your default web browser.

Leo checks that the url is valid before doing so. A valid url is:

-   3 or more lowercase alphas
-   followed by one ``:``
-   followed by one or more of:
-   ``$%&amp;'()*+,-./0-9:=?@A-Z_a-z{}~``
-   followed by one of: ``$%&amp;'()*+/0-9:=?@A-Z_a-z}~``

Url's should contain no spaces: use ``%20`` to indicate spaces. You may use any
type of url that your browser supports: http, mailto, ftp, file, etc.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.47">You can change the relative sizes of the outline and body panes by dragging the
splitter bar. The ``Equal Sized Panes`` command resizes the panes so that each
fills half of the main window.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.48">Leo supports unlimited undo for all typing and all commands. The
'undo_granularity' setting controls the granularity of undo. There are four
possible values:

``node``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to a new node.

``line`` (default)
    Starts a new undo unit when typing moves to new line.

``word``
    Starts a new undo unit when typing starts a new word.

``char`` (not recommended)
    Starts a new undo unit for each character typed.
    This wastes lots of computer memory.

``setUndoTypingParams`` calls ``recognizeStartOfTypingWord`` to recognize the
start of words. Plugins can modify ``recognizeStartOfTypingWord``. It should
return ``True`` if the typing indicated by the params starts a new 'word' for the
purposes of undo with 'word' granularity. ``setUndoTypingParams`` calls this
method only when the typing could possibly continue a previous word. In other
words, undo will work safely regardless of the value returned. See the actual
code for ``recognizeStartOfTypingWord`` for more details.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.92">An @asis tree is a tree whose root headline starts with @asis &lt;filename&gt;.  Similarly, for @noref and @nosent trees.

New in 4.2:  The following terms are equivalent.  The first form is preferred in each case.

@asis, @file-asis, @silent
@nosent, @file-nosent and @nosentinelsfile
@noref, @file-noref and @rawfile

You can get any combination of sentinels/no sentinels and references/no references using @file, @nosent, @noref and @asis trees:

                 Derived files        Sections and 
Type of tree   contain sentinels?   @others expanded?
------------   ------------------   -----------------
       @asis   no                   no
       @file   yes                  yes
      @noref   yes                  no
     @nosent   no                   yes
     
       

Leo can not update the outline from changes made from derived files unless those files contain sentinels.  The primary source for @nosent and @asis trees are the outlines from which those files were derived.

Leo creates files derived from @noref and @asis trees by writing the body text of all nodes of the tree in outline order.  Leo writes the body text _as is_, without recognizing section definitions, without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way.  In particular, Leo copies all directives, including @space or @c directives, to the derived file as text. However, Leo recognizes the @ignore directive in the _ancestors_ of @noref or @asis nodes, so you may use the @ignore directive as usual to prevent Leo from writing @rawfile and @silentfile trees.

Notes:

1. When writing @noref trees, Leo writes only the @+leo, @-leo, @+node, @-node, @+body and @-body sentinels.

2. Within @asis trees only, if a headline starts with @@, Leo writes everything in the headline following the @@ just before the corresponding body text.

3. Files derived from @asis trees contain _nothing_ not contained in body text (or @@ headlines).  In particular, if body text does not end in a newline, the first line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the preceding node.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.101">-   The ``New`` command creates a new Leo main window.

-   The ``Open`` command opens an existing Leo file and shows it in a main window.

-   The ``Close`` command closes the topmost Leo window,
    giving you an opportunity to save your work if you haven't yet done so.

-   The ``Save``, ``Save As`` and ``Save To`` commands save the Leo window to a file.
    The ``Save As`` command changes the name of the outline being edited;
    the ``Save To`` command does not.
    
    **New in Leo 4.4.3**: The ``Save File As Zipped`` command is the same as the
    ``Save As`` command except that the resulting .leo file is compressed with Python's zipfile module.
    Similarly, the ``Save File As Unzipped`` command is the same as the ``Save As`` command
    except that the resulting .leo file is not compressed.
    The ``Save``, ``Save As`` and ``Save To`` commands compress the file if it was originally compressed.
    **Note**: Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped or not.
    Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as the .leo file itself.
    Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or other program to expand the .leo file
    contained within.

-   The ``Revert`` command reloads a file, discarding any changes made to the file since it was last saved.

-   The ``Recent Files`` command brings up a submenu containing a list of recently
    opened files. Choosing an item in this submenu opens the selected file or brings
    it to the front.

-   The ``Clear Recent Files`` command deletes all entries in the Recent
    Files submenu except the most recent file. The files themselves are not
    affected, just the menu entries.

The following commands are located in the ``Read/Write`` menu, part of the
``File`` menu.

-   The ``Read Outline Only`` command reads an outline using only the .leo file, not any files derived
    from ``@file`` nodes. This command is useful for reverting a project to a
    previously saved state.

-   The ``Read @file Nodes`` command updates all ``@file`` nodes in an outline.
    This ensures that the state of an outline matches all files derived
    from ``@file`` nodes. 

-   The ``Write Outline Only`` command saves an outline without writing any ``@file``
    trees. Useful for inserting an @file node into an outline without modifying a
    derived file with the same name.

-   The ``Write @file Nodes`` command forces an update of all @file trees.

-   The ``Write Dirty @file Nodes`` command writes all ``@file`` trees that have been changed.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.102">The ``Open With`` command allows you to communicate with external editor. When
you select this command Leo creates a temporary file and invokes an external
program. Leo periodically checks whether this temporary file has changed; Leo
changes the corresponding node in the outline if so. You must create the entries
in the Open With submenu. This would typically be done in a hook routine, using
the createOpenWithMenuFromTable routine described in the child of this node. The
``@file mod_open_with.py`` node in ``LeoPlugins.leo`` gives a complete example
of handling the ``Open With`` menu.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.105">The ``Tangle``, ``Tangle All`` and ``Tangle Marked`` commands create derived
files from portions of an outline. These commands indent and format the derived
files so that they are easy to read and so that it is clear what sections
produced the code. The .c file in the Examples folder shows the code produced by
the Tangle commands. The ``Tangle`` command tangles only the selected portion of
the outline, the ``Tangle All`` command tangles the entire outline, and the
``Tangle Marked`` command tangles only marked headlines.

The ``Tangle`` commands create a derived file, call it F, from each ``@root``
node. This process is like macro expansion. The contents of F are simply the
body text of the ``@root node``, with each section reference replaced by its
definition. Substitution continues until all references to sections are replaced
with their definitions. By default, ``Tangle`` commands look for section
definitions only in the suboutline containing the ``@root`` directive being
tangled. That is, all sections are assumed to be defined either in the body text
of the headline, say h, containing the
@root directive, or in the body texts of the descendants of h.
The ``@unit`` directive changes the default scope of the tangle command, while
the ``@ignore`` directive causes the tangle commands to ignore a subtree. For
more details, see: `Tangling @root trees with the Tangle commands`_</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.106">The ``Untangle``, ``Untangle All`` and ``Untangle Marked`` commands are the
reverse of the corresponding ``Tangle`` commands. They update an outline based
on changes made to one or more derived files. These are exceptionally useful
commands. For example, suppose you create a new part of the outline and
``Tangle`` it for the first time. When you compile the resulting derived files
for the first time, you are likely to get many syntax errors. You could fix
those errors in the outline and Tangle the outline again, but there is a much
easier way: you fix the errors in the derived files using the compiler's editor,
then run the untangle command on the part of the outline that created the
derived file. The ``Untangle`` command updates the selected outline to match the
changes in the derived files. It's as simple as that. The ``Untangle`` command
marks all the nodes in the outline that it updates; you can examine all such
nodes with the ``Go To Next Marked`` command in the Outline menu. You cannot use
``Untangle`` to update doc parts, or leading comments in code parts or "trivial"
whitespace in code parts. This is a limitation of the ``Untangle`` command that
cannot be fixed; ``Untangle`` has no way of knowing whether leading comments
came from doc parts or are just leading comments.

``Untangle`` never changes the structure of an outline; it never inserts,
deletes or moves nodes. Don't attempt to change the structure of an outline by
modifying derived files; it won't work. Also, never delete, move or alter the
sentinel lines in derived files written by the Tangle command. Such lines start
with ``///`` followed by a section name. If you change the section name in a
sentinel line ``Untangle`` will not update the code in the outline (with the old
name) that generated the renamed section. Untangle now warns about sections that
appear in a derived file but not in the outline. Untangle has no trouble with
changed section references in derived files; it is only changed sentinel lines
that cause problems. Cloned nodes that generate code in several files may cause
problems for ``Untangle`` if not all the code is changed the same way in derived
files. If ``Untangle`` is run separately on these derived files, Untangle will
update all cloned nodes each time it is run, so only the code in the last
``Untangle`` run will take effect. Therefore, the only reliable way to update
text in cloned nodes is to make the change in the .leo file rather than the
derived files.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.108">The ``Import`` commands do not attempt to do perfect translations; they merely automate the bulk of the drudgery:

-   The ``Import to @file`` command creates an ``@file`` node from a file.

-   The ``Import to @root`` command creates an ``@root node`` from a file.

-   The ``Import CWEB Files`` command creates an @file node from a `CWEB`_ file.

-   The ``Import noweb Files`` command creates an @file node from a `noweb`_ file.

-   The Import Derived File command imports all the nodes in a derived file into the outline.
    Unlike the read commands, the command preserves no outline structure.

-   The ``Import Flattened Outline`` command converts plain text written in ``MORE`` format to an outline.

The ``Import Flattened Outline`` command brings up a dialog which will accept at
most one file. If that file contains MORE-format text it creates an outline
corresponding to that text. ``MORE`` is a now-defunct outliner program. ``MORE``
represents outlines as follows. Headlines are denoted by a leading ``+`` or
``-`` character, preceding by zero or more tabs that denote the level of the
headline. Body text follows its headline, with no indentation. The original
``MORE`` format did not escape lines in the body text that started with ``+`` or ``-``.
Leo escapes such characters by preceding ``+``, ``-`` or backslash with a
backslash.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.109">-   The ``Outline To CWEB`` command creates a `CWEB`_ file from the selected outline.

-   The ``Outline TO noweb`` command creates a `noweb`_ file from the selected outline.

-   The ``Flatten Outline`` command creates a text file in ``MORE`` format from the selected outline.
    See the previous section for a discussion of ``MORE`` format.

-   The ``Remove Sentinels`` command removes all sentinel lines from a file derived from an ``@file`` node.

-   The ``Weave`` Command formats the selected text and writes it to a file.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.110">The ``Quit`` command causes Leo to exit. You may also exit Leo by closing the
main window. You will be prompted to save any file that has been altered but not
saved.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.111"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.112">Leo supports unlimited undo and redo. Think of actions that may be undone or
redone as a string of beads. A "bead pointer" points to the present bead.
Performing an operation creates a new bead after the present bead and removes
all following beads. Undoing an operation moves the bead pointer backwards;
redoing an operation moves the bead pointer forwards. The ``Undo`` command is
disabled when the bead pointer moves in front of the first bead; the ``Redo``
command is disabled when the bead pointer points to the last bead.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.113">Leo supports the standard editing commands: ``Cut``, ``Copy``, ``Paste``,
``Clear`` and ``Select All``. These commands work with either headline or body
text.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.114">The ``Shift Left`` and ``Shift Right`` commands shift selected lines in the body
text left or right one tab position. These commands shift the entire line if any
characters in that line are selected.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.115">The Extract, Extract Section and Extract Section Names commands create child nodes whose headline is the first line of the selected body text.

-   The ``Extract command`` creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected body text and
    whose body is all other lines of selected text.
    Previously selected text is deleted from the original body text. 

-   The ``Extract Section command`` creates a new node whose headline is the first line of selected text and
    whose body is ``@code`` followed by all the other lines of selected text.
    All selected text lines except the first line are deleted from the original body text.
    This command is enabled only if the first line contains nothing but section name.

-   The ``Extract Section Names`` command creates one or more child nodes,
    one for each section name in the selected body text.
    The headline of each created node is the section name; the body text is ``@code`` followed by a newline.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.116">-   The Convert Tabs command converts leading tabs to blanks in a single node.
-   The Convert Blanks command converts blanks to tabs in a single node.
-   The Convert All Tabs converts leading tabs to blanks throughout the selected tree.
-   The Convert All Blanks command converts leading blanks to tabs throughout the selected tree.

All these commands convert between tabs and blanks using the tab width presently in effect.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.117">The ``Execute Script`` command executes body text as a Python script. Leo
execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected. The
``Execute Script`` command pre-defines the values ``c``, ``g`` and ``p`` as
follows:

- ``c`` is the commander of the outline containing the script.
- ``g`` is the leoGlobals modules.
- ``p`` is ``c.currentPosition()``.

**Important**: Body text may contain Leo directives and section references. You
can now use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute
interactively. Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script
or in descendant nodes.

Leo preprocesses all scripts by simulating the writing of a derived file to a
string. The ``Execute Script`` command sets ``app.scriptDict["script1"]`` to the
value of the script before preprocessing, and sets ``app.scriptDict["script2"]``
to the value of the script after preprocessing. Scripts may examine and change
app.scriptDict as they please.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.118">The following check boxes options appear in the search dialog and control the operations of the find and change commands.

Clone Find All
    When checked, the the Find All command creates a new root node called ``Found:`` *&lt;your search pattern&gt;*.
    This node contains clones of the nodes found by the Find All command.
    It is your responsibility to navigate to this new node and to clean it up when it's no longer needed.

Ignore Case
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands ignore the case of alphabetic characters when determining matches.

Mark Changes
    When checked, the ``Change`` command marks all headlines whose headline or body text are changed by the command.

Mark Matches
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands mark all headlines in which a match is found with the pattern.

Pattern Match
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands treat several characters specially in the find pattern.
    
    - '*'  matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
    - '.'  matches any single character.
    - '^'  matches a newline at the start of a pattern.
    - '$'  matches a newline at the end of a pattern.

Examples::

    "^abc$" matches lines that only contain "abc".
    "^a" matches any line starting with "A".
    "a$" matches any line ending with "a".
    "^*$" matches any line at all.

Reverse
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands search backward through the file.

Search Body Text
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands search body text.

Search Headline Text
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands search headline text.

Show Context
    When checked, the ``Find All`` command shows additional context information when printing matches.

Suboutline Only
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands search only the currently selected headline and its offspring.

Whole Word
    When checked, the find pattern must match an entire word.
    Words consist of an alphabetic character or underscore, followed by zero or more
    alphabetic characters, numbers or underscores.

Wrap Around
    When checked, the ``Find and Change`` commands continues at the top of the file when
    the command reaches the bottom of the file.
    For reverse searches, the find or change command continues at the bottom of the file when
    the command reaches the top of the file.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.134">The ``Go To Line Number`` command selects the locations in your outlines corresponding to a line in a derived file.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.136">The ``Insert Body Time/Date`` and ``Insert Headline Time/Date`` commands insert
formatted time and date into body or headline text. You must be editing a
headline to be able to insert the time/date into the headline.
The `` body_time_format_string`` and ``headline_time_format_string`` settings
specify the format of the inserted text. These settings are the format string
passed to time.strftime. For a complete list of the format options see
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html
If the format specified by either of these two settings is erroneous the
``"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"`` format is used by default, resulting in a time/date
format like::

    1/30/2003 8:31:55</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.137">The Reformat Paragraph command rearranges the words in a text paragraph to fill
each line as full as possible, up to the ``@pagewidth`` setting. A paragraph is
delimited by blank lines, Leo directives, and (of course) start and end of text
in a node. The width of the line used by the reformatting operation is governed
by ``@pagewidth`` and the indentation that would be applied to the node when
tangled (as part of a ``@root``) or written (as part of a ``@file``).

The command operates on the paragraph containing the insert cursor. If the
insert cursor is on a blank line or directive, nothing happens. If the cursor is
on a line containing text, then the paragraph containing that text line is
reformatted and the insert cursor is moved to the next paragraph.

**Note**: Hanging indentation is preserved. This is most useful for bulleted or
numbered lists, such as::

  1. This is the first paragraph,
     and it has a hanging indentation.

  2. This is the second paragraph,
     and it too has a hanging indentation.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.139">The ``Match Brackets`` command is enabled if the cursor is next to one of the
following characters in the body pane:

    ( ) [ ] { } &lt; &gt;

This command looks for the matching character, searching backwards through the
body text if the cursor is next to `)` `]` `}` or `&gt;` and searching forward through the
text otherwise. If the cursor is between two brackets the search is made for the
bracket matching the leftmost bracket. If a match is found, the entire range of
characters delimited by the brackets is highlighted and the cursor is placed
just to the left of the matching characters. Thus, executing this command twice
highlights the range of matched characters without changing the cursor.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.140">Leo stores options in ``@settings`` trees, that is, outlines whose headline is
``@settings``. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for ``@settings`` trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.
The key design goal of ``@settings`` trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with ``@settings`` trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, much more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.

**New in Leo 4.4.2**: The ``myLeoSettings.leo`` file is a way of ensuring that your
customized settings are not altered when updating Leo from cvs or while
installing a new version of Leo. The myLeoSettings.leo acts much like Python's
site-customize.py file. The ``myLeoSettings.leo`` file will never be part of any Leo
distribution, and it will never exist in Leo's cvs repository. This solution is
*much* better than tring to update leoSettings.leo with scripts.

The ``Settings`` command opens the file leoSettings.leo.

Leo stores options in ``@settings`` trees, that is, parts of Leo outlines whose root
node has the headline ``@settings``. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for
``@settings`` trees in the following places:

- The file ``leoSettings.leo`` in the leo/config directory.
- The file ``leoSettings.leo`` in the user's home directory.
- The file ``myLeoSettings.leo`` in the leo/config directory.
- The file ``myLeoSettings.leo`` in the user's home directory.
- The file being loaded.

Settings that appear later in the above list override settings found earlier. For
example, any setting specified in an ``@settings`` tree in the file being loaded
overrides any setting seen in any ``leoSettings.leo`` file.

The following sections describe the kinds of nodes in ``@settings`` trees.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.143"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.144">-   The ``Check Outline`` command checks the outline for consistency.

-   The ``Check All Python Code`` and ``Check Python Code`` commands report any syntax errors or tabnanny errors.
    These commands mark erroneous nodes and ignore any nodes for which:

        - ``@ignore`` is in effect or
        - ``@language python`` is in not effect.

-   The ``Check Python Code`` and ``Pretty Print Python Code`` pretty print body text.
    You can customize this code by overriding the following methods of class ``prettyPrinter`` in ``leoCommands.py``::
    
        putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
        putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.145">-   The ``Insert Headline`` command inserts a new headline after the presently selected headline,
    either as the next sibling or the first child of the presently selected headline
    if the presently selected headline has children and is expanded.

-   The ``Clone Node`` creates a clone of the selected node.
    See `Clones and views`_ for full details about clones.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.146">-   The ``Cut Outline`` and ``Copy Outline`` commands copy a text
    representation of the outline to the clipboard. This representation is the same
    as the file format with some information deleted.

-   The ``Paste`` command (in the ``Edit`` menu) copies this representation into the *body* pane.

-   The ``Paste Node As Clone`` command pastes the node from the clipboard, retaining the
    identity of nodes.  Thus, if the pasted node already exists in the outline the newly
    pasted node will become of a clone of the already-existing node.

-   The ``Paste Outline`` command creates nodes with new identities (new gnx's).</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.147">-   The ``Expand`` command expands the currently selected node so that all its children are visible.
-   The ``Expand All Subheads`` command expands the currently selected node so that all its offspring are visible.
-   The ``Expand All`` command expands all the nodes of the entire tree.
-   The ``Contract Parent`` contracts the selected node's parent and selects the parent node.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.148">-   The ``Hoist`` command redraws the screen so presently selected tree becomes the only visible part of the outline.
    Hoist commands may be nested.  

-   The De-hoist command restores the outline.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.149">-   The ``Mark Headline`` command marks a headline with a red marker  near the leader characters.
-   The ``Unmark Headline`` command removes such a mark.
-   The ``Mark Subheads`` command marks all offspring of the currently selected node.
-   The ``Unmark All`` command removes the marks from the entire tree.
-   The ``Mark Changed Items`` command marks all headlines whose headline or
    body text has been changed since the file was last saved.
-   The ``Mark Changed Roots`` command marks all changed headlines whose body text contains the ``@root`` directive.
    This command is especially useful with the Tangle Marked command.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.150">-   The ``Move Up``, ``Move Down``, ``Move Left`` and ``Move Right`` commands move the currently selected node.

-   The ``Promote command`` makes all the children of a node siblings of the node.

-   The ``Demote`` command makes all the siblings that follow a node children of the node.

-   The ``Sort Children`` command sorts all children of the present node in alphabetical order of their headlines.

-   The ``Sort Siblings`` command sorts all siblings of the present node in alphabetical order.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.151">-   The ``Equal Sized Panes`` command adjusts the sizes of the outline and body
    panes so that they are the same height.
-   The ``Cascade`` command cleans up the screen by cascading all Leo windows.
-   The ``Minimize All`` command minimizes all Leo windows.
-   The ``Toggle Active Pane`` command toggles keyboard focus between the outline and body panes.
-   The ``Toggle Split Direction`` command switches between vertical and horizontal
    orientations of the Leo window. In the vertical orientation, the body pane
    appears below the pane containing the outline and log panes. In the horizontal
    orientation, the body pane appears to the left the pane containing the outline
    and log panes. By default, the ratio of pane outline pane to the body pane is
    0.5 in the vertical orientation and 0.3 in the horizontal orientation. These two
    ratios may be changed using settings.
-   The ``Open Compare Window`` command opens a dialog that allows you to compare
    two files, one containing sentinels and one not.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.157">-   The ``About Leo`` command puts up a dialog box showing the version of Leo.

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.162">The following paragraphs discuss the main benefits of traditional `literate programming`_.
**Note**: none of these benefits depends on printed output.

**Design and coding happen at the highest possible level**.
The names of sections_ are constrained only by one's design skill, not by any
rules of language. You say what you mean, and that becomes both the design and
the code. You never have to simulate a concept because concepts become `section
names`_.

**The visual weight of code is separate from its actual length**.
The visual weight of a section_ is simply the length and complexity of the
`section name`_, regardless of how complex the actual definition of the section
is. The results of this separation are spectacular. No longer is one reluctant
to do extensive error handling (or any other kind of minutia) for fear that it
would obscure the essence of the program. Donald Knuth stresses this aspect of
literate programming and I fully agree.

**Sections show relations between snippets of code**.
Sections_ can show and enforce relationships between apparently unrelated pieces
of code. Comments, macros or functions are other ways to indicate such
relationships, but often sections are ideal. Indeed, a natural progression is to
create sections as a matter of course. I typically convert a section to a
function only when it becomes apparent that a function's greater generality
outweighs the inconvenience of having to declare and define the function.

**Complex section names invite improvements**.
A `section name`_ is complex when it implies unwholesome dependencies between the
caller (user) of the section and the section_ itself. Such section names tend to
be conspicuous, so that the programmer is lead to revise both the section name
and its purpose. Many times my attention has been drawn to a poorly conceived
section because I didn't like what its name implied. I have always been able to
revise the code to improve the design, either by splitting a section into parts
or be simplifying its relation to colleagues.

**Sections create a place for extensive comments**.
One of the most surprising thing about `literate programming`_ is how severely
traditional programming tends to limit comments. In a conventional program the
formatting of code must indicate structure, and comments obscure that
formatting. Sections_ in literate programming provide a place for lengthy
comments that do not clutter the code at the place the section is
referenced_.

**Section names eliminate mundane comments**.
The `section name`_ often says it all. The reference_ to the section says everything
that the user needs to know, and the section name at the point of definition
also eliminates the need for many comments.

**Sections create comments automatically**.
A typical `@root node`_ starts out with something like::

	&lt;&lt; includes for class x &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt; private data for class x &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt; private prototypes for class x &gt;&gt;
	&lt;&lt; functions of class x &gt;&gt;

In the derived file there is a comment that looks like this::

	/// &lt;&lt; includes for class x &gt;&gt;

It would be silly to write this comment by hand, though often programmers do
just that in order to have a place holder for a mark in the source file. With
`literate programming`_ the situation is different: the comment indicates that the
code came from a particular section_; that is, the comment servers a real
purpose.

**Literate programming clarifies the shape of code**.
These last several paragraphs have discussed comments in detail because the net
effect of "putting comments where they belong" is that comments don't clutter
the code. `Section references`_ hide irrelevant detail, so larger-scale patterns
within functions (or declarations) become more apparent. Often just recasting
code into web format has created Aha's about my own code, with no special
attention to recoding or redesign! Recasting a function as a web raises the real
and apparent level of abstraction.

**I spend less time formatting code**.
Formatting no longer has to indicate overall design; sections do that. I am less
obsessive about formatting code; it simply doesn't matter much whether different
sections are formatted consistently because the format of one section has no
effect on the look of other sections. Also, I don't worry about most line breaks
within `documentation parts`, or about adding comment delimiters.

**Literate programming creates a new design dimension**.
Sections_ add a new dimension to the design and coding process. Choices about
what sections do, what they are named, what order they appear in, are choices in
a design space different from "normal" programming. This an abstract concept, to
be sure. However, the previous paragraphs are really a manifestation of
working in this new design space.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.173">Outlines_ add something brand new to traditional `literate programming`_, namely an
explicit mechanism for expressing structure at any level of detail, from largest
overall view to smallest detail. The following paragraphs elaborate on this theme.

**Outlines add context**.
There are too many sections_ in conventional `literate programming`. It becomes
difficult to understand the relationships between sections. Using an outline_ to
express a literate programming instantly solves this problem. The programmer is
always aware of how sections are related.

**Outlines provide scope for commands**.
Outlines_ provide a convenient way of expressing the intended scope of commands.
For example, the ``Tangle`` command operates only on the presently selected tree_.
The ``Extract Section`` command creates a new section_ as the last child_ of the
present node_.

**Clones create different views and focus attention**.
Clones_ can create different views of the outline. An outline_ can contain many such views.
`Clones &amp; views`_ discusses the implications of clones in detail.

**Outlines increase flexibility**.
`Organizer nodes`_ do not affect derived files in any way, but organizer nodes
often convey the most information about the structure and design of a large
system. Decoupling structure from content in this way is precisely what is
needed for flexibility: one can reorganize at will without worrying about
changing the meaning of the code.

**Outlines express hierarchy directly**.
Hierarchy is often implicit in programming: for example, the grouping of
functions into files, or the organization of a single file as a set of
functions, etc. An outline_ directly expresses hierarchy. Many of Leo's commands_
operate on the presently selected node. It is natural to apply operations on
selected node_ of the outline.

**reStructuredText is much easier to use than CWEB markup.**
Leo's `rst3 plugin`_ makes it easy to use reStructuredText_ (rST) instead of CWEB_
markup. For most purposes, rST suffices, and rST is much easier to use and less
intrusive than CWEB_.

**Outlines create new design dimensions**.
There are many ways to express a program as a Leo outline. Such choices are
important. They add clarity to the entire program. These are different *kind* of
choices. They simply can not be expressed at all in other editors. In other
words, such choices exist in a new design space. 

**Leo improves tangling and adds untangling**.
Tangling_ and untangling_ are fundamental operations of `literate programming`_.
Leo tangles and untangles files derived from `@file trees`_ automatically. This
is an important convenience.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.181">Leo changes the theory and practice of literate programming as follows:

**Leo reduces the need for comments**.
In particular, bridge or transition phrases are almost always unnecessary in a
Leo outline_. One never needs to say something like, "having just finished
with topic x, we turn now to topic y." Leo's outlines tend to be far less
chatty than flat literate programs.

**Leo reduces the need for printed listings**.
Experience with the ``Weave`` command shows that an outline can easily become
unintelligible when printed, no matter how "beautiful" the typeset printout is.
No printed listing can be as clear as Leo's outline view.

**Leo reduces the need for indices and tables of contents**.
You could say the entire outline is a table of contents. Moreover, sections_
must always be defined in a descendant of the node_ containing the `section
reference`_, so there is very little need for an index. 

**Leo shows that outline structure is more powerful than narrative.**
Indeed, narrative style creates severe maintenance problems. The narrative is
soon forgotten, and when that happens it becomes difficult to find anything. The
few times I have tried narrative organization I soon regretted it: things just
weren't where I expected them to be.

**Leo shows that traditional literate programming encourages a too creative approach to programming.**
A dictionary is a better model for programs than a novel. Leo's outlines provide
a more regular organization, while providing space for the most lengthy
discussions when those discussions are required.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.224">Naively using plugins can expose you and your .leo files to malicious attacks.
The fundamental principles are::

    Scripts and plugins must never blindly execute code from untrusted sources.

and::

    .leo files obtained from other people may potentially contain hostile code.

Stephen Schaefer summarizes the danger this way::

    I foresee a future in which the majority of leo projects come from
    marginally trusted sources...a world of leo documents sent hither and yon -
    resumes, project proposals, textbooks, magazines, contracts - and as a race
    of Pandora's, we cannot resist wanting to see "What's in the box?" And are
    we going to fire up a text editor to make a detailed examination of the
    ASCII XML? Never! We're going to double click on the cute leo file icon, and
    leo will fire up in all its raging glory. Just like Word (and its macros) or
    Excel (and its macros).

In other words::

    When we share "our" .leo files we can NOT assume that
    we know what is in our "own" documents!

Not all environments are untrustworthy. Code in a commercial cvs repository is
probably trustworthy: employees might be terminated for posting malicious code.
Still, the potential for abuse exists anywhere.

In Python it is very easy to write a script that will blindly execute other scripts::

    # Warning: extremely dangerous code

    # Execute the body text of all nodes that start with `@script`.
    def onLoadFile():
        for p in c.allNodes_iter():
            h = p.headString().lower()
            if g.match_word(h,0,"@script"):
                s = p.bodyString()
                if s and len(s) &gt; 0:
                    try: # SECURITY BREACH: s may be malicious!
                        exec(s + '\n')
                    except:
                        es_exception()

Executing this kind of code is typically an intolerable security risk.
**Important**: rexec provides *no protection whatever*.
Leo is a repository of source code, so any text operation is potentially malicious.
For example, consider the following script, which is valid in rexec mode::

    badNode = c.currentPosition()
    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        &lt;&lt; change `rexec` to `exec` in p's body &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; delete badNode &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; clear the undo stack &gt;&gt;

This script will introduce a security hole the .leo file without doing anything
prohibited by rexec, and without leaving any traces of the perpetrating script
behind. The damage will become permanent *outside* this script when the user
saves the .leo file.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.240">The plugins test suite creates a new convention: if a plugin has a function at
the outer (module) level called ``unitTest``, Leo will call that function when
doing unit testing for plugins. So it would be good if writers of plugins would
create such a ``unitTest function``. To indicate a failure the ``unitTest`` just
throws an exception. Leo's plugins test suite takes care of the rest.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.242">Leo reads and writes "foreign" attributes in ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements in .leo files as follows:

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create ``t.unknownAttributes`` or ``v.unknownAttributes`` ivars for
  any ``tnode`` or ``vnode`` whose corresponding ``&lt;v&gt;`` or ``&lt;t&gt;`` element in the .leo file contains a foreign attribute.

- The ``unknownAttributes`` ivars are dictionaries whose keys are the attribute names and whose values are strings.

- When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes if a ``vnode`` or ``tnode`` contains an ``unknownAttributes`` ivar.

- The only native attribute of ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements is ``tx``.

- The native attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements are ``a``, ``t``, ``vtag`` and ``tnodeList``.

- The native attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements are ``marks``, ``expanded`` and ``descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes``.

- Non-native attributes are called **foreign** attributes.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the ``unknownAttributes`` ivars.

Plugins may cause Leo to write such foreign attributes simply by attaching unknownAttributes ivars to a vnode or tnode.
Like this::

	if hasattr(v,"unknownAttributes"):
		v.unknownAttributes ["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	else:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

See the section called "Recommended conventions for plugins" for advice about
how to avoid potential conflicts in naming new attributes.

All members of these dictionaries should be "pickleable". That is, Leo uses
Python's Pickle module to encode all values in these dictionaries. Leo will
discard any attributes that can not be pickled. This should not be a major
problem to plugins. For example, instead of putting a tnode into these
dictionaries, a plugin could put the tnode's gnx (a string) in the dictionary.

Leo writes only ``t.unknownAttributes`` when writing ``@thin`` trees to the .leo
file. Leo puts (the encoding of) these elements into an attribute called
``descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes``. This attribute is part of the ``&lt;v&gt;``
element representing the ``@thin`` node. Leo does _not_ write
``v.unknownAttributes`` in ``@thin`` trees because *only tnodes have gnx's in
thin derived files*. In effect, vnodes are anonymous. We could attempt to get
around this by identifying vnodes by their corresponding tnodes, but that's not
a general solution and it is, in effect, equivalent to writing only
``t.unknownAttributes``. So it seems pointless to "pretend" to be writing
``v.unknownAttributes``.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using
unknownAttributes is concerned. This won't work in all cases. For example, a
plugin that creates an arbitrary directed graph between vnodes must distinguish
between joined vnodes. In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file
trees, or just vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.247">In May of 1999 I began work on the Borland version of Leo for Windows.  The Borland Delphi classes were a pleasure to use and free of bugs.  I redesigned Leo's file format for the Windows version of Leo;  the Yellow Box file format is a binary format that requires the Yellow Box runtime.  Fortunately, I choose to use XML for Leo's file format. I have Marc-Antoine Parent to thank for this decision; he urged me to use XML and patiently explained how to use XML properly.  However, there are two significant problems with the Borland version of Leo.  First, it works only on Windows.  Second, it can never be Open software, because it uses Borland's Delphi classes and a commercial syntax coloring component.

In October of 2001 I began work on the leo.py, an Open Software version of leo.py, a version of Leo written in Python and Tk.  At last I have found the proper platform for Leo.  leo.py naturally supports scripting in Python.  The combination of Python and Tk is incredibly powerful, very easy to use, and truly cross platform.  I rewrote Leo in Python in about two months!  For the first time in my career I no longer am anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in Python.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.248">The following sections give a pseudo-chronological list of the major Aha's
involved in creating Leo2. These Aha's form the real design and theory of
operation of Leo. See the "Diary", "Notes" and "Letters to Speed Ream" sections
in LeoDocs.leo for a more accurate and less tidy history of Leo2.

I am writing these notes for several reasons. First, the initial design and
coding of Leo2, spanning a period of about 8 weeks, was some of the most
creative and rewarding work I have ever done. The result is elegant and simple.
I'm proud of it. Second, much of the design work is not reflected in the code,
because improved design often eliminated code entirely. The final code is so
elegant that it obscures the hard work that created it. Third, you must
understand this design in order to understand the implementation of @file trees
and their derived files. Someday someone else may take charge of Leo. That
person should know what really makes Leo2 work.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.249">In the summer of 2001 I began work on a project that for a long time I had considered impossible.  I had long considered that "private" file formats such as .leo files were the only way to represent an outline properly and safely.  I'm not sure exactly what changed my mind, but I finally was willing to consider that information embedded in derived files might be useful.  This meant accepting the possibility that sentinel lines might be corrupted.  This was a crucial first step.  If we can trust the user not to corrupt sentinel lines than we can embed almost any kind of information into a derived file.

There were several motivations for this work.  I wanted to eliminate the need for explicit Tangle and Untangle commands. I thought of this as "Untangle on Read/Tangle on Write."  If tangling and untangling could be made automatic it would save the user a lot of work.  I also wanted to make derived files the primary sources files.  .leo files might be made much smaller derived files contained the primary source information. This hope turned out to be false.

The result of this design work was something I originally called Leo2, though I now usually prefer to talk about @file trees.  Initially most design issues were unresolved or unknown. I resolved to attempt a robust error-recovery scheme, not knowing in advance what that might involve. I also wanted to solve what I thought of as the "cross-file clone" problem: clones that point from a .leo outline into a derived file. With Leo1 cross-file clones do not exist; everything is in the same .leo file. It was clear that Leo2 would have to change some aspects of clones, but all details were fuzzy.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.250">The next step was also crucial.  I started to use Leo1 as a prototype to design what the new body pane would look like to the user. In retrospect, using Leo1 as a prototype for Leo2 was just as inspired as using MORE as a prototype for Leo1.  Both prototypes marked the true beginning of their respective projects.  The Leo2 prototype was a mockup in Python of the code for reading and writing derived files. The file LeoDocs.leo contain these first prototype nodes.

Writing the prototype got me thinking about improving noweb.  With my experience with Leo1, I was able to create a new markup language that took advantage of outline structure.  I called the new language  "simplified noweb", though that terminology is obsolete.  I created @file nodes to distinguish between the old and new ways of creating derived files.  In Leo1, the @code directive is simply an abbreviation for a section definition line.  Simplified noweb used @c as an abbreviation for @code.  More importantly, simplified noweb used @c to separate doc parts from code parts without necessarily specifying a section name.  It quickly became apparent that most nodes could be unnamed.  All I needed was the @others directive to specify the location for all such unnamed nodes.

From the start, simplified noweb was a joy to use. Indeed, the @others directive could replace all section definition lines.  Furthermore, I could make @doc directive optional if the body pane started in "code mode".  But this meant that plain body text could become a "literate" program! This was an amazing discovery.  These Aha's got me excited about Leo2. This was important, as it motivated me to do a lot of difficult design work.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.251">In spite of this excitement, I was uneasy. After much "daydreaming" I realized that I was afraid that reading and writing derived files would be interrupted by a long series of alerts. I saw that designing the "user interaction" during reading and writing would be very important. The next Aha was that I could replace a long series of alerts with messages to the log window, followed by a single "summary" alert. Much later I saw how to eliminate alerts entirely.

At this time I thought there would be two kinds of "errors" while reading derived files. Warnings would alert the user that something non-serious had happened. True errors would alert the user that data might have been lost. Indeed, if Leo2 saves orphan and ignored nodes in a .leo file under an @file node, then read errors could endanger such nodes. Much later I saw that a robust error recovery scheme demands that @file nodes not contain orphan and @ignored nodes. (More on this subject later.) But if orphan and @ignored nodes are moved out of @file trees, there are no read errors that can cause data loss! So the distinction between warnings and errors finally went away.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.252">I next turned my attention to writing @file nodes.  A huge Aha: I realized that sentinel lines must contain both a leading and a trailing newline.  The general principle is this: the write code must contain absolutely no "conditional" logic, because otherwise the read code could not figure out whether the condition should be true or false.  So derived files contain blank lines between sentinel lines. These "extra" newlines are very useful, because the read (untangle) code can now easily determine exactly where every blank, tab and newline of the derived file came from.  It would be hard to overstate how important this simplifying principle was in practice.

Much later, with urging from a customer, I realized that the write code could safely remove "extra" newlines between sentinels with a caching scheme in the low level atFile::os() routine. This scheme does not alter the body of the write code in any way: in effect, sentinels still contain leading and trailing "logical" newlines. The read code had to be modified to handle "missing" leading newlines, but this can always be done assuming that sentinels still contain logical leading and trailing newlines!

At about this time I designed a clever way of having the write code tell the read code which newlines were inserted in doc parts. (The whole point of doc parts is to have the write code format long comments by splitting long lines.) To quote from my diary:

"We can use the following convention to determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks: A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline if and only if the newline is preceded by whitespace. This is a really elegant convention, and is essentially invisible to the user.
Tangle outputs words until the line would become too long, and then it inserts a newline. To preserve all whitespace, tangle always includes the whitespace that terminates a word on the same line as the word itself. Therefore, split lines always end in whitespace. To make this convention work, tangle only has to delete the trailing whitespace of all lines that are followed by a 'real' newline."

</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.253">After the write code was working I turned my attention to the read (untangle) code.  Leo's Untangle command  is the most complex and difficult code I have ever written. Imagine my surprise when I realized that the Leo2 read code is essentially trivial! Indeed, the Leo2 untangle code is like an assembler. The read code scans lines of a derived files looking for "opcodes", that is, sentinel lines, and executes some simple code for each separate opcode. The heart of this code is the scanText routine in atFile.cpp.

The read code was written and debugged in less than two days! It is the most elegant code I have ever written. While perfecting the read code I realized that sentinel lines should show the complete nesting structure found in the outline, even if this information seems redundant. For example, I was tempted to use a single sentinel to represent an @other directive, but finally abandoned this plan in favor of the @+other and @-other sentinels.

This redundancy greatly simplified the read code and made the structure of derived files absolutely clear. Moreover, it turned out that we need, in general, all the information created by the present sentinel lines. In short, sentinels are as simple as they can be, and no simpler.

The atFile::createNthChild method is a very important: it ensures that nodes will be correctly inserted into the outline. createNthChild must be bullet-proof if the Read code is to be robust. Note that the write code outputs @node sentinels, that is, section definitions, in the order in which sections are referenced in the outline, not the order in which sections appear in the outline. So createNthChild must insert the n'th node of parent p properly even if p contains fewer than n-1 children! The write code ensures that section references are properly nested: @node sentinels are enclosed in @node sentinels for all their ancestors in the @file tree. createNthChild creates dummy siblings as needed, then replaces the dummy siblings later when their actual definitions, that is, @node sentinels, are encountered.

At this point the fundamental read/write code was complete. I found three minor bugs in the code over the next week or so, but it was clear that the read/write code formed a rock-solid base from which to continue design and implementation. This was an entirely unexpected surprise.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.254">At this point I could read and write derived files "by hand", using temporary Read and Write commands. The next step was to integrate the reading and writing of derived files with the loading and saving of .leo files.  From time to time I made minor changes to the drivers for the read/write code to accommodate the Load and Save code, but at no time did I significantly alter the read or write code itself.

The user interaction of the Load and Save commands drove the design and implementation of the load/store code. The most important questions were: "what do we tell the user?", and "what does the user do with the information?" It turns out that the user can't make any complex decision during error recovery because the user doesn't have nearly enough information to make an informed choice. In turn, this means that certain kinds of error recovery schemes are out of the question...</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.255">I now turned my attention to "attributes" of nodes.  Most attributes, like user marks, are non-essential. However, clone information is essential; we must never lose clone links. At this time I had a preliminary design for cross-file clones that involved a two part "pointer" consisting of a full path name and an immutable clone index within the derived file. Eventually such pointers completely disappeared, but the immutable clone indices remain.

My first thought was that it would be good to store all attributes in @node sentinels in the derived file, but experience showed that would be irritating. Indeed, one wants Leo2 to rewrite derived files only if something essential has changed. For example, one doesn't want to rewrite the derived file just because a different node as been selected.

At this point I had another Aha: we can use the .leo file to store all non-essential attributes. For example, this means that the .leo file, not the derived files, will change if we select a new node. In effect, the .leo file mirrors the derived file. The only reason to store nodes in the .leo file under an @file node is to carry these attributes, so Leo2 wrote dummy nodes that do not reference body text.  Much later I saw that dummy nodes were dangerous and that .leo files should contain all information found in derived files.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.256">The concept of mirroring created a huge breakthrough with cross-file clones: Here is an excerpt of an email i sent to my brother Speed:

"I realized this morning that since a .leo file contains dummy vnodes for all nodes in a derived file, those dummy nodes can carry clone info! I changed one line to make sure that the write code always writes clone info in dummy vnodes and voila! Cross-file clones worked!"

All of Leo1's clone code could be used completely unchanged. Everything "just works".</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.257">At first I thought we could make sure that the .leo file always correctly mirrors all derived file, but disastrous experience showed that is a completely false hope. Indeed, backup .leo files will almost never mirror derived file correctly. So it became urgent to find a completely fool-proof error recovery scheme.

I had known for quite a while that error recovery should work "as if" the mirroring nodes were deleted, then recreated afresh. Several failed attempts at an error recovery scheme convinced me that error recovery would actually have to delete all dummy nodes and then do a complete reread. This is what Leo2 does.

But erasing dummy nodes would destroy any orphan and ignored nodes--by definition such nodes appear nowhere in the derived file. Therefore, I had to enforce the rule that @file nodes should contain no such nodes. Here is an email I wrote to my brother, Speed Ream discussing what turned out to be the penultimate error recovery scheme:

"The error recovery saga continues. After much pondering and some trial coding I have changed my mind about orphans and @ignored nodes. They simply should never appear as descendants of @file nodes. Fortunately, this simplifies all aspects of Leo2.
Leo2 will issue a warning (not an error) if an orphan or @ignored node appears as the descendant of an @file node when a .leo file is being saved. If any warnings occur while writing the derived file, Leo2 will write the "offending" @file tree to the .leo file instead of the derived file. This has several advantages:

1.	The user gets warned about orphan nodes. These are useful warnings! Orphan nodes arise from missing @others directives or missing section references.

2. The user doesn't have to change anything immediately in order to save an outline. This is very important. Besides warnings about orphans, Leo2 will also warn about undefined or unreferenced sections. User's shouldn't have to fix these warnings to do a Save!

3. No errors or alerts will occur during Reading or Writing, so the user's anxiety level goes way down. At worst, some informational message will be sent to the log. The user will never have to make important decisions during Loads or Saves. [At last the dubious distinction between errors and warnings disappears.]

4. Error recovery can be bullet-proof. Simple code will guarantee that after any read operation the structure of an @file node will match the structure of the derived file. Also, sentinels in derived files will now account for all children of an @file node. There are no more "missing nodes" that must be filled in using the .leo file. Finally, error recovery will never change the @file tree in any way: no more "recovered nodes" nodes.

5. The present read code can be used almost unchanged. The only addition is the posting of a warning if the structure of the .leo file does not match the structure of the derived file. We need a warning because non-essential attribute of nodes (like user marks) may be altered."

This ends the original history of Leo2. In fact, it took quite a while before Leo recovered properly from all errors. I finally saw that .leo files should duplicate all information in derived files. This allows a .leo file to be used a single backup file and allows maximal error recovery in all situations.  It took several months to stamp out several subtle bugs involving clones that caused spurious read errors. Such errors undermine confidence in Leo and can cause disastrous reversions. See my diary entries for January 2002 in leo.py for details.

</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.259">The more I look at Tk, the more convinced I am that Python + Tk (aka Tkinter)
is, by far, the best way to go with Leo. I now have Open Source code for tree
widgets and splitter windows, and have intensely studied how to modify that code
for use in Leo. It is clear, even at this early date, that this code will
provide a very pleasant base on which to build Leo.

The tree code is based on code in ``IDLE``, the Python IDE. This code is simple,
good and plenty fast enough. The tree code draws directly to a Tk canvas object.
The look and feel matches Windows exactly. It would be trivial to use Mac
triangle icons instead of the Windows plus and minus icons. It would also be
trivial to modify the look and feel for Linux.

The tree widget code solves several intractable problems with ``wxTreeCtrl``.
Moving nodes becomes trivial. Bugs in ``wxTreeCtrl`` involving editing and
redrawing disappear. Using Python/Tk code simplifies the vnode class, and having
access to the vnode class simplifies and speeds up the tree widget code. It will
now be possible to bind keystrokes properly; this simply can not be done in
``wxWindows``. The tree widget code shows just how trivial the Windows native
tree control is. The Tk canvas is a splendid example of higher-level code being
superior, in every way, to lower level code.

Another big win comes from using the Tk text widget. This widget is
extraordinarily powerful. The only text control that rivals it is the
``MacOS/Yellow Box`` text control. Indeed, the Tk text widget does everything that
Leo could possibly want. One can even embed images in text.

In short, using Tk for Leo will be fast enough and will greatly increase what is
possible in Leo while at the same time greatly simplifying Leo's code. I am
about to convert Leo from wxPython to Python + Tk.
Edward K. Ream, November 4, 2001</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.260">I've known for a while that Python was interesting; I attended a Python
conference last year and added Python support to Leo. But last week I got that
Python is something truly remarkable. I wanted to convert Leo from wxWindows to
wxPython, so I began work on c2py, a Python script that would help convert from
C++ syntax to Python. While doing so, I had an Aha experience. Python is more
than an incremental improvement over Smalltalk or C++ or objective-C; it is
"something completely different". The rest of this post tries to explain this
difference.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.261"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.262">All versions of Leo are organized as a collection of classes. The general
organization of Leo has remained remarkably stable throughout all versions of
Leo, although the names of classes are different in different versions.
Smalltalk's Model/View/Controller terminology is a good way think about Leo's
classes. **Model classes** represent the fundamental data. The vnode and tnode
classes are Leo's primary model classes.

**View classes** draw the screen. The main view classes are leoFrame.py and
leoTree.py. The colorizer class in leoColor.py handles syntax coloring in the
body pane. Leo's view classes know about data stored in the vnode class. Most
events (keystrokes and mouse actions) in the outline and body pane are handled
in the leoTree class. The leoFrame class also creates the Leo window, including
menus, and dispatches the appropriate members of the controller classes in
response to menu commands.

**Controller classes** (aka commanders) control the application. In Leo,
controllers mostly handle menu commands. Commanders create subcommanders to
handle complex commands. The atFile class reads and writes files derived from
``@file`` trees. The LeoFind class handles the Find and Change commands. The
leoImportCommands class handles the Import and Export commands, the
tangleCommands class handles the Tangle and Untangle commands and the undoer
class handles the Undo command. Other classes could be considered controller
classes.

Each Leo window has its own commander and subcommanders. Subcommanders are not
subclasses of their commander. Instead, subcommanders know the commander that
created them, and call that commander as needed. Commanders and subcommanders
call the model and view classes as needed. For example, the Commands class
handles outline commands. To move a headline, the commander for the window calls
a vnode move routine to alter the data, then calls the view class to redraw the
screen based on the new data.

A singleton instance of the **LeoApp** class represents the application itself.
All code uses the app() global function to gain access to this singleton member.
The ivars of the LeoApp object are the equivalent of Leo's global variables.
leo.py uses no global Python variables, except the gApp variable returned by
app(). leoGlobals.py defines all application constants. Naturally, most
constants are local to the class that uses them.

Several classes combine aspects of model, view and controller. For example, the
**LeoPrefs** class represents user preferences (model), the Preference Panel
(view) and the Preferences menu command (controller). Similarly, the **LeoFind**
class represents find settings, the Find/Change dialog, and the Find/Change
commands.

We use the following convention throughout this documentation. Any variable
named ``c`` is a commander, i.e., an instance of the Commands class in
``leoCommands.py``. Variables named ``v`` and ``t`` are vnodes and tnodes respectively.
These classes are defined in ``leoNodes.py``.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.263">The vnode and tnode classes represent most of the data contained in the outline.
These classes are Leo's fundamental Model classes. A **vnode** (visual node)
represents a headline at a particular location on the screen. When a headline is
cloned, vnodes must be copied. vnodes persist even if they are not drawn on the
screen. Commanders call vnode routines to insert, delete and move headlines.

The vnode contains data associated with a headline, except the body text data
which is contained in tnodes. A vnode contains headline text, a link to its
tnode and other information. Vnodes contain structure links: parent, firstChild,
next and back ivars. To insert, delete, move or clone a vnode the vnode class
just alters those links. The Commands class calls the **leoTree** class to redraw
the outline pane whenever it changes. The leoTree class knows about these
structure links; in effect, the leoTree and vnode classes work together.

A **tnode**, (text node) represents body text. All vnodes that are clones of
each other share the same tnode. In other words, tnodes are the unit of sharing
of body text. The tnode class is more private than the vnode class. Most
commanders deal only with vnodes, though there are exceptions.

Because Leo has unlimited Undo commands, Leo deletes vnodes and tnodes only when
a window closes. Leo deletes nodes indirectly using ``destroy`` methods. Several
classes, including the vnode, tnode, leoFrame and leoTree classes, have
``destroy`` methods. ``destroy`` methods merely clear links so that Python's and
Tkinter's reference counting mechanisms will eventually delete vnodes, tnodes
and other data when a window closes.

Leo's XML file format uses **tnode indices** to indicate which tnodes (t
elements) belong to which vnodes (v elements). Such indices are required. Even
if we duplicated the body text of shared tnodes within the file, the file format
would still need an unambiguous way to denote that tnodes are shared. Present
versions of Leo use **gnx's** (global node indices) as node indices. These indices
do not change once a node has created. This reduces cvs conflicts.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.264">Leo must redraw the outline pane when commands are executed and as the result of mouse and keyboard events.
The main challenges are eliminating flicker and handling events properly.
These topics are interrelated.

**Eliminating flicker**. Leo must update the outline pane with minimum flicker.
Various versions of Leo have approached this problem in different ways. The
drawing code in leo.py is robust, flexible, relatively simple and should work in
almost any conceivable environment. Leo assumes that all code that changes the
outline pane will be enclosed in matching calls to the c.beginUpdate and
c.endUpdate methods of the Commands class. c.beginUpdate() inhibits drawing
until the matching c.endUpdate(). These calls may be nested; only the outermost
call to c.endUpdate() calls c.redraw() to force a redraw of the outline pane.

Code may call ``c.endUpdate(flag)`` instead of ``c.endUpdate()``. Leo redraws
the screen only if flag is true. This allows code to suppress redrawing entirely
when needed. For example, here is how the idle_body_key event handler in
leoTree.py conditionally redraws the outline pane::

	redraw_flag = false
  	c.beginUpdate()
	val = v.computeIcon()
	if val != v.iconVal:
		v.iconVal = val
		redraw_flag = true
	c.endUpdate(redraw_flag) # redraw only if necessary

The leoTree class redraws all icons automatically when ``c.redraw()`` is called.
This is a major simplification compared to previous versions of Leo. The entire
machinery of drawing icons in the vnode class has been eliminated. The
``v.computeIcon`` method tells what the icon should be. The ``v.iconVal`` ivar
tells what the present icon is. The event handler simply compares these two
values and sets ``redraw_flag`` if they don't match.

**Handling events.** Besides redrawing the screen, Leo must handle events or
commands that change the text in the outline or body panes. It is surprisingly
difficult to ensure that headline and body text corresponds to the vnode and
tnode corresponding to presently selected outline, and vice versa. For example,
when the user selects a new headline in the outline pane, we must ensure that 1)
the vnode and tnode of the previously selected node have up-to-date information
and 2) the body pane is loaded from the correct data in the corresponding tnode.
Early versions of Leo attempted to satisfy these conditions when the user
switched outline nodes. Such attempts never worked well; there were too many
special cases. Later versions of Leo, including leo.py, use a much more direct
approach. The event handlers make sure that the vnode and tnode corresponding to
the presently selected node are always kept up-to-date. In particular, every
keystroke in the body pane causes the presently selected tnode to be updated
immediately. There is no longer any need for the ``c.synchVnode`` method, though
that method still exists for compatibility with old scripts.

The leoTree class contains all the event handlers for the body and outline
panes. The actual work is done in the ``idle_head_key`` and ``idle_body_key`` methods.
These routines are surprisingly complex; they must handle all the tasks
mentioned above, as well as others. The ``idle_head_key`` and ``idle_body_key`` methods
should not be called outside the leoTree class. However, it often happens that
code that handles user commands must simulate an event. That is, the code needs
to indicate that headline or body text has changed so that the screen may be
redrawn properly. The leoTree class defines the following simplified event
handlers: ``onBodyChanged``, ``onBodyWillChange``, ``onBodyKey``, ``onHeadChanged`` and
``onHeadlineKey``. Commanders and subcommanders call these event handlers to
indicate that a command has changed, or will change, the headline or body text.
Calling event handlers rather than ``c.beginUpdate`` and ``c.endUpdate`` ensures that
the outline pane is redrawn only when needed.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.265">Since version 4.2, Leo represents clones by sharing tnodes. Cloned vnodes share
the same tnode. This shared tnode represents the entire shared subtree of both
clones. Thus, the ``_firstChild`` link must reside in *tnodes*, not *vnodes*.

Because vnodes may be visited many times during a complete traversal of a tree,
a vnode does not represent unique location on the screen. As a result, the
**position** class had to be invented. ``c.rootVnode`` and ``c.currentVnode``
now return *positions* instead of vnodes. The position class was designed to
allow compatibility with old scripts. Old code can use positions just like they
used to use vnodes.

Earlier versions of Leo duplicated all the descendents of vnode v when cloning
v. This created many complications that no longer exist. In particular, in the
new scheme a vnode v is cloned if and only if ``len(v.t.vnodeList) &gt; 1``.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.266">The find and change commands are tricky; there are many details that must be
handled properly. The following principles govern the LeoFind class:

1.  Find and Change commands initialize themselves using only the state of the
    present Leo window. In particular, the Find class must not save internal
    state information from one invocation to the next. This means that when the
    user changes the nodes, or selects new text in headline or body text, those
    changes will affect the next invocation of any Find or Change command.
    Failure to follow this principle caused all kinds of problems in the Borland
    and Macintosh codes. There is one exception to this rule: we must remember
    where interactive wrapped searches start. This principle simplifies the code
    because most ivars do not persist. However, each command must ensure that
    the Leo window is left in a state suitable for restarting the incremental
    (interactive) Find and Change commands. Details of initialization are
    discussed below.

2.  The Find and Change commands must not change the state of the outline or body
    pane during execution. That would cause severe flashing and slow down the
    commands a great deal. In particular, the ``c.selectPosition`` and ``c.editPosition``
    methods must not be called while looking for matches.

3.  When incremental Find or Change commands succeed they must leave the Leo
    window in the proper state to execute another incremental command. We
    restore the Leo window as it was on entry whenever an incremental search
    fails and after any Find All and Change All command. Initialization involves
    setting the ``self.c``, ``self.v``, ``self.in_headline``, ``self.wrapping`` and
    ``self.s_text`` ivars.

Setting ``self.in_headline`` is tricky; we must be sure to retain the state of
the outline pane until initialization is complete. Initializing the Find All and
Change All commands is much easier because such initialization does not depend
on the state of the Leo window. Using Tk.Text widgets for both headlines and
body text results in a huge simplification of the code.

Indeed, the searching code does not know whether it is searching headline or
body text. The search code knows only that ``self.s_text`` is a Tk.Text widget that
contains the text to be searched or changed and the insert and sel Tk attributes
of self.search_text indicate the range of text to be searched. Searching
headline and body text simultaneously is complicated. The selectNextVnode()
method handles the many details involved by setting ``self.s_text`` and its insert
and sel attributes.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.267">This section describes Leo's explicit ``Tangle`` and ``Untangle`` commands. Such
commands operate only on ``@root`` and ``@unit`` trees. The previous chapter discusses
the implicit Tangle on Write/Untangle on Read processes used to read and write
``@file`` trees.

The ``Tangle`` command translates the selected ``@root`` tree into one or more
well-formatted C source files. The outline should contain directives, sections
references and section definitions, as described in Chapter 4. The Untangle
command is essentially the reverse of the ``Tangle`` command. The Tangle command
creates a derived file from an ``@root`` tree; the Untangle command incorporates
changes made to derived files back into the ``@root`` tree.

The ``Tangle`` command operates in two passes. The first pass discovers the complete
definitions of all sections and places these definitions in a symbol table. The
first pass also makes a list of root sections. Definitions can appear in any
order, so we must scan the entire input file to know whether any particular
definition has been completed.

This second pass creates one file for each ``@root`` node. ``Tangle`` rescans each
section in the list of roots, copying the root text to the output and replacing
each section reference by the section's definition. This is a recursive process
because any definition may contain other references. We can not allow a section
to be defined in terms of itself, either directly or indirectly. We check for
such illegally recursive definitions in pass 2 using the section stack class.
``Tangle`` indicates where sections begin and end using comment lines called
sentinel lines. The this part of the appendix discusses the format of the
sentinels output by the ``Tangle`` command.

The key design principle of the ``Tangle`` command is this::

    Tangle must output newlines in a context-free manner.

That is, ``Tangle`` must never output conditional newlines, either directly or
indirectly. Without this rule ``Untangle`` could not determine whether to skip or
copy newlines.

The ``Tangle`` command increases the indentation level of a section expansion the
minimum necessary to align the section expansion with the surrounding code. In
essence, this scheme aligns all section expansions with the line of code in
which the reference to the section occurs. In some cases, several nested
sections expansions will have the same indentation level. This can occur, for
example, when a section reference in an outline occurs at the left margin of the
outline.

This scheme is probably better than more obvious schemes that indent more
"consistently." Such schemes would produce too much indentation for deeply
nested outlines. The present scheme is clear enough and avoids indentation
wherever possible, yet indents sections adequately. End sentinel lines make this
scheme work by making clear where the expansion of one section ends and the
expansion of a containing section resumes.

``Tangle`` increases indentation if the section reference does not start a line.
Untangle is aware of this hack and adjusts accordingly. This extra indentation
handles several common code idioms, which otherwise would create under-indented
code. In short, ``Tangle`` produces highly readable output, given the necessity
of preserving newlines for ``Untangle``.

``Untangle`` is inherently complex. It must do a perfect job of updating the
outline, especially whitespace, from expansions of section definitions created
by the Tangle command. Such expansions need not be identical because they may
have been generated at different levels of indentation. The ``Untangle`` command
can not assume that all expansions of a section will be identical in the derived
file; within the derived file, the programmer may have made incompatible changes
to two different expansions of the same section. ``Untangle`` must check to see
that all expansions of a section are "equivalent". As an added complication,
derived files do not contain all the information found in ``@root`` trees.
``@root`` trees may contain headlines that generate no code at all. Also, an
outline may define a section in several ways: with an ``@c`` or ``@code``
directive or with a section definition line. To be useful, Untangle must handle
all these complications flawlessly. The this part of the appendix discusses the
various conventions used in the sentinels output by the ``Tangle`` command.
These conventions allow the ``Untangle`` command to recreate whitespace
correctly.

``Untangle`` operates in two passes. The first pass finds definitions in the
derived file and enters them into the **Untangle Symbol Table**, or UST.
Definitions often include references to other sections, so definitions often
include nested definitions of referenced sections. The first pass uses a
definition stack to keep track of nested definitions. The top of the stack
represents the definition following the latest reference, except for the very
first entry pushed on the stack, which represents the code in the outline that
contains the ``@root`` directive. The stack never becomes empty because of the
entry for the ``@root`` section. All definitions of a section should
match--otherwise there is an inconsistent definition. This pass uses a forgiving
compare routine that ignores differences that do not affect the meaning of a
program.

The second pass of ``Untangle`` enters definitions from the outline into the
**Tangle Symbol Table**, or TST. The second pass simultaneously updates all
sections in the outline whose definition in the TST does not match the
definition in the UST. The central coding insight of the Untangle command is
this:  **the second pass of Untangle is almost identical to the first pass of
Tangle**. That is, ``Tangle`` and ``Untangle`` share key parts of code, namely the
``skip_body`` method and its allies. Just when ``skip_body`` enters a definition
into the symbol table, all the information is present that ``Untangle`` needs to
update that definition.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.268">Leo uses unicode objects in vnodes and tnodes to denote headline and body text.
Note that unicode strings have no encoding; only plain strings have encodings.
This means that once an (encoded) plain string has been converted to a unicode
string it doesn't matter how the unicode string was created. This is the key
that makes Leo's new code robust: internally Leo never has to worry about
encodings. Encoding matter only when encoded strings are converted to and from
Unicode. This happens when Leo reads or writes files.

Python expressions that mix unicode strings u and plain strings s, like one of these::

	u + s
	u == s
	u[5] == s[2:]

are promoted to unicode objects using the "system encoding". This encoding
should never be changed, but we can't assume that we know what it is, so for
safety we should assume the most restrictive encoding, namely "ascii". With this
assumption, Leo's code can't throw an exception during these promotions provided
that: 

- All strings are converted to unicode when Leo reads files or gets text from Tk.Text widgets.

- All string literals in Leo's code have only ascii characters.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.269">Unlimited undo is straightforward; it merely requires that all commands that
affect the outline or body text must be undoable. In other words, everything
that affects the outline or body text must be remembered. We may think of all
the actions that may be Undone or Redone as a string of beads (undo nodes).

Undoing an operation moves backwards to the next bead; redoing an operation moves
forwards to the next bead. A bead pointer points to the present bead. The bead
pointer points in front of the first bead when Undo is disabled. The bead
pointer points at the last bead when Redo is disabled. An undo node is a Python
dictionary containing all information needed to undo or redo the operation. The
Undo command uses the present bead to undo the action, then moves the bead
pointer backwards.

The Redo command uses the bead after the present bead to redo the action, then
moves the bead pointer forwards. All undoable operations call setUndoParams() to
create a new bead. The list of beads does not branch; all undoable operations
(except the Undo and Redo commands themselves) delete any beads following the
newly created bead. I did not invent this model of unlimited undo.
I first came across it in the documentation for Apple's Yellow Box classes.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.282">To convert an ``@root`` tree to an ``@file`` tree, choose the root of the tree to be converted,
then do the following in the Python window::

	import c2py
	c2py.leo1to2()

This script makes numerous changes throughout the tree.
It does not, however, change ``@root`` to ``@file``, or insert the needed ``@others`` directives.
You must do that by hand.

To convert ``@root`` trees to ``@file`` trees by hand:

1.  Change the ``@root`` node to an ``@file`` node.
    That is, delete the ``@root &lt;filename&gt;`` from the body text and insert ``@file &lt;filename&gt;`` in the headline.
    Typically, the root node contains a reference like ``&lt;&lt;methods of class x&gt;&gt;`` as the last body text.
    Replace this reference with the ``@others`` directive.
    The expansion of @others is all text that is not part of a section definition.

2.  Add ``@`` to the start of all doc parts.
    Leo starts syntax coloring in code mode rather than doc mode,
    so if a doc part starts body text it should start with ``@``

3.  Replace all section definition lines (like ``&lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;=``) by ``@c``.
    This results in the node being added to the expansion of ``@others``.

4.  Remove all unused code from the ``@file`` tree.
    Leo does not write derived files whose ``@file`` trees contain orphan or ``@ignore`` nodes.

5.  Make sure that all nodes defining a section have a headline that starts with ``&lt;&lt;section&gt;&gt;``.
    This will typically be true when converting ``@root`` trees that use the ``@code`` directive.

6.  If a section is referenced in more than one node (a rare occurrence in my code),
    clone the defining node and move one clone under each referencing node.

7.  If a node contains the definitions of several sections,
    place each different definition in a different node.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040524104904.357">This technical information may be of use to those wanting to process Leo files with special-purpose filters.
Leo's uses XML for its file format.
The following sections describe this format in detail.
**Important**:
The actual read/write code in leoFileCommands.py is the authoritative guide.
When in doubt about what Leo actually writes, look at an actual .leo file in another editor.

Here are the elements that may appear in Leo files.
These elements must appear in this order.

``&lt;?xml&gt;``
    Leo files start with the following line::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

``&lt;?xml-stylesheet&gt;``
    An xml-stylesheet line is option.  For example::
    
        &lt;?xml-stylesheet ekr_stylesheet?&gt;

``&lt;leo_file&gt;``
    The ``&lt;leo_file&gt;`` element opens an element that contains the entire file.
    ``&lt;/leo_file&gt;`` ends the file.

``&lt;leo_header&gt;`` 
    The ``&lt;leo_header&gt;`` element specifies version information and other information
    that affects how Leo parses the file.  For example::
    
        &lt;leo_header file_format="2" tnodes="0" max_tnode_index="5725" clone_windows="0"/&gt;
    
    The ``file_format`` attribute gives the 'major' format number.
    It is '2' for all 4.x versions of Leo.
    The ``tnodes`` and ``clone_windows`` attributes are no longer used.
    The ``max_tnode_index``	attribute is the largest tnode index.

``&lt;globals&gt;``
    The ``globals`` element specifies information relating to the entire file.
    For example::
    
        &lt;globals body_outline_ratio="0.50"&gt;
            &lt;global_window_position top="27" left="27" height="472" width="571"/&gt;
            &lt;global_log_window_position top="183" left="446" height="397" width="534"/&gt;
        &lt;/globals&gt;
    
    -   The ``body_outline_ratio attribute`` specifies the ratio of the height of the body pane to
        the total height of the Leo window.
        It initializes the position of the splitter separating the outline pane from the body pane.
    
    -   The ``global_window_position`` and ``global_log_window_position`` elements
        specify the position of the Leo window and Log window in global coordinates:

``&lt;preferences&gt;``
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the ``&lt;preferences&gt;`` element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty ``&lt;preferences&gt;`` element.

``&lt;find_panel_settings&gt;``
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the ``&lt;find_panel_settings&gt;`` element when reading.
    Leo writes an empty ``&lt;find_panel_settings&gt;`` element.

``&lt;clone_windows&gt;``
    This element is vestigial.
    Leo ignores the ``&lt;clone_windows&gt;`` element when reading.
    Leo no longer writes ``&lt;clone_windows&gt;`` elements.

``&lt;vnodes&gt;``
    A single ``&lt;vnodes&gt;`` element contains nested ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements.
    ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements correspond to vnodes.
    The nesting of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements indicates outline structure in the obvious way.

``&lt;v&gt;``
    The ``&lt;v&gt;`` element represents a single vnode and has the following form::
    
        &lt;v...&gt;&lt;vh&gt;sss&lt;/vh&gt; (zero or more nested v elements) &lt;/v&gt;
    
    The ``&lt;vh&gt;`` element specifies the headline text.
    ``sss`` is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.
    As shown above, a ``&lt;v&gt;`` element may contain nested ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements.
    This nesting indicates outline structure in the obvious way.
    Zero or more of the following attributes may appear in ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements::
    
        t=name.timestamp.n
        a="xxx"
    
    The ``t="Tnnn"`` attribute specifies the tnode associated with this vnode.
    The ``a="xxx"`` attribute specifies vnode attributes.
    The ``xxx`` denotes one or more upper-case letters whose meanings are as follows::
    
        C	The vnode is a clone. (Not used in 4.x)
        E	The vnode is expanded so its children are visible.
        M	The vnode is marked.
        T	The vnode is the top visible node.
        V	The vnode is the current vnode.
    
    For example, ``a="EM"``  specifies that the vnode is expanded and is marked.

    **New in 4.0**:
    
    -   ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements corresponding to ``@file`` nodes now contain ``tnodeList`` attributes.
        The ``tnodeList`` attribute allows Leo to recreate the order in which nodes should appear in the outline.
        The ``tnodeList`` attribute is a list of gnx's: global node indices.
        See ``Format of derived files (4.x)`` for the format of gnx's.
    
    -   Plugins and scripts may add attributes to ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements.
        See `Chapter 13: Writing plugins`_ for details.

``&lt;tnodes&gt;``
    A single ``&lt;tnodes&gt;`` element contains a non-nested list of ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements.

``&lt;t&gt;``
    The ``&lt;t&gt;`` element represents a single tnode and has this form::
    
        &lt;t tx="Tnnn"&gt;&lt;tb&gt;sss&lt;/tb&gt;&lt;/t&gt;
    
    The ``tx`` attribute is required.
    The ``t`` attribute of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements refer to this ``tx`` attribute.
    The ``&lt;tb&gt;`` element specifies the body text.
    ``sss`` is the headline text encoded with the usual XML escapes.

    **New in 4.0**:
    Plugins and scripts may add attributes to ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements.
    See `Chapter 13: Writing plugins`_ for details.

<t tx="EKR.20040601084317">Leo 4.2 alpha 3           June 1, 2004

This version fixes completes the essential features of version 4.2.  All known incompletions and bugs involving shared nodes and Leo's new file format have been fixed.  BTW, this version of Leo completes Leaps 201 and 202.

It should be safe to use this version for collaboration between Leo's developers.  I hereby encourage people to start using cvs for collaboration.  Only by doing so will we discover any possible problems.

The only item that must be completed before releasing 4.2 beta is fixing the Go To Line Number command so it supports thin derived files.

There are many known bugs in this version: most are minor bugs that have been around for a long time.  All known bugs will be fixed by the first release candidate.  See the to-do list in LeoPy.leo for the complete list.

The highlights of this version:

- All features of @file-thin are now complete and appear to be stable.
	- All .leo files in the distribution use @thin files where possible.
	- Leo ignores all directives within the range of the @all directive.
	- The @+middle and @-middle sentinels allow sections to be defined in any descendant node.
	- The @clone sentinel marks duplicate cloned siblings.
- The beginnings of a new undo scheme are in place.
- @thin, @nosent, @noref and @asis are abbreviations for @file-thin, @file-nosent, @file-noref and @file-asis.
- Created new iterators that return lists of vnodes and tnodes, including iterators that remove all duplicates from those lists.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317.2"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317.99">This happened after write errors such as orphan nodes.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317.102">Added u.registerUndoHandlers.

This will become largely unnecessary in the new undo scheme.  It's good to have though.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317.142">When writing .leo files Leo now pickle's and hexlify's all data in the v.unknownAttribute and t.unknownAttribute dictionaries.  When reading .leo files Leo does the reverse.

Leo ignores all elements in these dictionaries if some element can not be pickled.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601084317.161">I have fallen madly in love with generators.  The following new iterators are defined with generators.

c.all_positions_iter
c.all_tnodes_iter
c.all_vnodes_iter
c.all_unique_tnodes_iter
c.all_unique_vnodes_iter

p.tnodes_iter
p.vnodes_iter

<t tx="EKR.20040601101227.1"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601101430">This bug exists in 4.1 final.  Leo did not properly show the found text in headlines.  The fix was in the code that redraws the screen, not in the find/change code itself.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040601102703">The new scheme simply saves all information in one or more vnodes and their associated tnodes.  This is a general scheme that can be used by almost any command.

At present only the u.saveTree method exists.  Coming soon, u.saveNode, u.saveNodeAndChildren and u.saveListOfNodes.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040601102808">See the to-do list in LeoPy.leo for a list of known bugs in this version.

<t tx="EKR.20040628095213">Leo 4.2 beta 2           July 5, 2004
Leo 4.2 beta 1           June 30, 2004

The highlights of 4.2 beta 2:

- Leo now writes the entire contents of @ignore'd @thin trees to the .leo file.
This change ensures that users can create and remove @ignore directives without
any chance of losing data inadvertently.

- Leo now saves and restores marks and the expansion state of nodes in @thin trees.

- Leo marks @thin nodes as dirty whenever they become "newly unignored", i.e.,
when an @thin node no longer falls in the range of an @ignore directive.

Beta 1 completes all fundamental work in the 4.2 code base. All essential code
is complete. Dozens of bugs have been fixed since the Alpha 3 release about a
month ago.

Known bugs in 4.2 beta 2:

- Not all plugins work correctly.
- Some plugins leak memory very slightly.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
derived files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

Other features of 4.2:

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.
- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.
- The usual assortment of bug features and minor features.

Coming soon in 4.2:

- Perfect Import will guarantee that Leo imports file perfectly.
- @import will allow you to study files using Leo without changing those files.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.3">@nocolor

- Leo calls g.enableIdleTimeHook at end of startup code.
	- This means that g.idleTimeHookHandler gets called periodically, even if no hooks have been defined.
	- g.enableIdleTime hook now calls g.app.gui.setIdleTimeHook at most once.

- app.forceShutdown now calls "end1" hook before calling app.finishQuit.
	- This ensures that the "end1" hook always gets called once.
	- app.finishQuit calls doHook("end1",...) only if it hasn't been called before.
		- This isn't necessary, but it makes traces in doHook less confusing.

- idleTimeHookHandler now calls the idle-time hook for all open windows.
	- So having multiple windows open should not affect idle-time hooks.

** Warning: new convention required to workaround apparent Tk problems.
	- "idle" hooks should return if g.app.killed is True.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.23">@color

The Leo icon can eliminate the need for the word Leo.

What I did:

- Eliminate Leo in name of Find panel.
- Derived leoTkinterPrefs from leoTkinterDialog: creates icon.
- Derived leoComparePanel from leoTkinterDialog: creates icon.
- Eliminated the -t option when opening Idle: the idle window is now called "Python Shell"</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.121">- idle_body_key must call g.scanDirectives in order to support @tab_width.
	- This must be done for tabs and newlines.

- Fixed bug in g.scanDirectives that was rejecting negative tabwidth values.
	- This bug did not exist in the other versions of scanDirectives.

- With a negative tabwidth, a backspace now computes what spaces are equivalent to a tab and delete all of those.  This is easy to do!

This allows Alt-f to work properly.

- Return "break" after the "final" text has been computed if nothing has changed.

This suppresses spurious newlines.

A new idea:  Make sure the text _does_ have a newline at all times.  I'm not sure this will work...

- ALWAYS set the text in select.  This prevents some weird problems with trailing newlines.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.334">- The string passed to exec now includes sentinels.

goToLineNumber needs sentinels to work properly.

- Fixed bug in is_special that broke p.isAtAllNode.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.485">There was a small hole in the format of derived files.  Leo assumed that comment delimiters do not change within any particular derived file.  This assumption is not necessarily true in files like leoProjects.txt.

What I did:

- putDirective and readDirective now check for @langauge and @comment, and change comment delims appropriately.

This is slightly dubious: after all, an @langauge directive in the middle of most derived files will cause havoc.  However, one could say that this is the users problem :-)

BTW, this doesn't really solve all problems in @all trees: Leo can still get mightily confused about comment delims if the user doesn't put proper @language directives in @all trees.
</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.490">readEndNode uses the existing tempBodyString attribute to determine if the body text has changed.  If so, we mark the tnode dirty.  The code in 

top_df.read.&lt;&lt; copy all tempBodyStrings to tnodes &gt;&gt;

propagates the dirty marks to all ancestor @file nodes.  This can't be done in readEndNode because no positions are available at that time.</t>

<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.499"></t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.501">Leo now writes t.unknownAttributes to the .leo file when writing the &lt;v&gt; element corresponding to the root of an @thin tree.  Leo will do this by writing a new xml attribute, descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, in &lt;v&gt; element.

Leo will only write t.unknownAttributes, not v.unknownAttributes.  This is because only tnodes have gnx's in thin derived files.  In effect, vnodes are anonymous.  We could attempt to get around this by identifying vnodes by their corresponding tnodes, but that's not a general solution and it is, in effect, equivalent to writing only t.unknownAttributes.  This being so, it seems pointless to "pretend" to be writing v.unknownAttributes.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using unknownAttributes is concerned.  As I've stated in the past, this won't do if, for example, a plugin is trying create an arbitrary directed graph between vnodes.  In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file trees, or just vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.</t>
<t tx="EKR.20040628095213.512">The problem was setting endSentinelComment to None instead of "" in readDirective.

Chapter 1: Installing Leo
##########################################

This chapter tells how to install and run_ Leo.

**Important**:
    
If you have *any* problems installing Leo,
please ask for help on Leo's help forum:

.. contents::</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.49">Leo will work on any platform that supports Python 2.2.1 or later and Tk 8.4 or later.

-   Download the latest version of Leo from `Leo's download page`_.

-   Download Python from: http://python.org/

-   Most installations of Python have Tk pre-installed.
    If your doesn't, you may download it from: http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/
    
    **Warning**: When building Tcl on Linux, do **not** specify
    "--enable-threads".
    Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

-   Leo uses `Pmw`_ (Python Mega Widgets). Leo's extensions folder contains a copy
    of Pmw for use if needed. Leo first tries to import Pmw normally. If that
    fails, Leo will use the version of Pmw in the extensions folder.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.50">Download the latest version of Leo (a .zip file) from `Leo's download page`_.
   
Unzip the downloaded .zip file into a folder in your home directory.
The folder will be called something like leo-4-4-3-final.

You now have two choices:
    
1. You can run Leo from your home directory.
   Just add  ~/leo-4-4-3-final to your path.

2. You can install leo into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin by running Leo's install script as follows::
    
    cd ~/leo-4-4-3-final
    chmod u+x install
    sudo ./install
    
The install script will instruct you to add /usr/local/bin to your path.

Now you are ready to `run Leo`_.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.60">Leo will open .leo files automatically provided that you associate leo.py with .leo files.
Here is how to open Leo when double-clicking a .leo file on Windows 2K or XP:


-   In Windows 2K or XP, go to ``Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control panel``, open the ``Folder Options`` tab.
-   Select the ``file types`` tab. Press the ``New`` button.
-   Enter ``Leo`` into the ``Create New File Extension`` field. Press OK.
-   With ``Leo`` still highlighted in the ``Registered File Types`` list box, press the ``Advanced`` button.
-   Change the default file type field to something like ``Leo Literate Outline``.
-   Press the ``Icon`` button and browse to the ``LeoDoc`` icon in Leo's ``Icons`` folder.
-   Click OK. This gets the icons right and registers the description of the .leo file.

You now have to tell windows what to do to open the file properly:

-   Press the new button to open the ``New Action`` window.
-   In the ``Action`` field type ``Open``, then type **one** of the following lines::

    [python install dir]\pythonw.exe   [leo install dir]\leo.py %1
    [python install dir]\python.exe -i [leo install dir]\leo.py %1
    
**Important**: The -i option is not valid when using pythonw.exe.
Any call to pythonw -i will cause pythonw.exe to exit immediately.

The first  line opens Leo files with no console window.
The second line opens Leo files with a console window and leaves the window open after Leo exits.
You should now be able to double click on a leo file in explorer with Leo.</t>

*** Alpha quality code:  Please make full backups before playing with this code!

This release marks another significant milestone in Leo's history:

- Leo's 4.x file code is complete.  At present I have no plans to change the format of .leo files or derived files.  I am eating my own dog food: I do all my editing with the 4.1 code base.

- Leo uses immutable gnx's (id:timestamp:n) by default to associate tnodes with vnodes in .leo files.  This makes Leo as cvs friendly as possible.  From now on .leo files will be checked in to cvs with the -ko (text/keywords off) option.

- The use_gnx setting in leoConfig.txt determines whether uses gnx's (cvs friendly) or ints.  No version of Leo before 4.1 can read .leo files containing gnx.   Only gnx's are immutable.  Leo recomputes all non-gnx indices from scratch whenever writing a .leo file. It is possible to convert between 3.x and 4.1 file formats by changing the use_gnx setting.

- The 4.1 code base has been reorganized to support gui's other than tkinter.  Leo's src directory contains several new source files.

- The file test.leo in the test directory contains real regression tests for syntax coloring.   Regression testing scripts create regression tests dynamically from data in Leo's outline.  Very cool, very easy, very general.  In particular, regression tests may use temporary nodes in test.leo rather than creating separate Tk windows for testing.

Known bugs:

- The Extract commands eat one character too much.

- The __wx_gui.py plugin is only partly functional.</t>

More than a year in the making, Leo 4.0 is finally here.

Highlights of 4.0 final:
-----------------------

** Improved and simplified format of derived files.
	- Eliminated child indices, extraneous blank lines and @body sentinels.
	- Eliminated @node sentinels that indicate outline structure.
	- New @nl and @nonl sentinels indicate where newlines are and aren't.
	- These changes will largely eliminate unwanted cvs conflicts.

** Greatly improved error handling.
	- Reading derived files _never_ alter outline structure or links.
	- Read errors leave the outline completely unchanged.
	- Broken clone links are gone forever.
	- As a result, 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.

** Full compatibility will previous versions of Leo.
	- Leo 4.0 reads all derived files properly, regardless of version.
	- Leo writes new-format derived files by default, and this default may be changed.
	- New commands in the read/write menu allow you to explicitly specify the format of derived files.

* New commands:
	- Write 3.x Derived File and Write 4.x Derived File.
	- Import Derived File.
	- Clear Recent Files.

* Dozens of other improvements, including:
	- Better Unicode support.
	- New configuration settings.
	- Several new plugins.

Highlights of 4.0 beta 3
------------------------

- Fixed problems with setting Leo's window icons.
- Plugins may now save their own information in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo files.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.76">Leo can now read and write "foreign" attributes in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo files:

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create t.unknownAttributes or v.unknownAttributes ivars for any tnode and vnode object whose corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt; element in the .leo file contains a foreign attribute.

- The unknownAttributes ivars are a dictionary whose keys are the attribute names and whose values are strings.

- When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes if  a vnode or tnode contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- The only "native" attributes that Leo expects to find are the "tx" attribute in &lt;t&gt; elements and the "a", "t", "vtag" and "tnodeList" attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements.  Everything else is a foreign attribute.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the unknownAttributes ivars.

Plugins may cause Leo to write such foreign attributes simply by attaching unknownAttributes ivars to a vnode or tnode.  For example:

	v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

It would be best not to delete other foreign attributes, so the following would be preferred:

	if hasattr(v,"unknownAttributes"):
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	else:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

Another way:

	try:
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	except AttributeError:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.100">The Synchronization Principle simplifies everything and at long last puts Leo on a firm theoretical foundation.  This principle states that the "smallest unit of meaning" of any Leo outline is the entire outline itself.  In particular, individual derived files have meaning only in the context of a particular outline.

The Synchronization Principle has the following happy consequences:

1. We may assume that all derived files are in synch with the outline that wrote them.  This assumption allows Leo to use "hidden machinery" in the outline to associate nodes in the derived file with nodes in the outline.  This "hidden" machinery consists of a list of tnodes associated with @file vnodes in the outline.  When writing a derived file Leo creates a list of tnodes in the order they were written to the derived file.  When reading the derived file, Leo uses this list to associate nodes in the derived file with nodes in the outline.

2. Derived files must get their structure from the .leo file that wrote them.  As we have seen, this is done using the hidden machinery in the .leo file.  Consequently, there is no further need to represent outline structure in derived files.  There is no need any longer either for child indices or for sentinels to represent outline structure.  As a result, we can eliminate @+body and @-body nodes entirely because all @+node sentinels are followed by body text.

3. All .leo files must contain full outline structure.  Even "thin" outline will contain the full representation of the outline as vnodes.

4. Reading _never_ alters outline structure in the outline.  No vnodes are ever created or destroyed and reading never alters clone links.  This is true whether or not read errors occur.  The read code sets a temporary attribute of tnodes while reading.  These attributes are copied to the permanent t.bodyString attribute only if no read errors were encountered.

4. Error recovery is now trivial:  Read errors indicate that the .leo files and one or more derived files are out-of-synch.  No error recovery is attempted: the @file tree in which the error occurred reverts back to its original state.

5. The new Import Derived File command is the _only_ way to recover data from mismatched derived file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.101"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.102">The write_old_format_derived_files option in leoConfig.leo and leoConfig.txt determines which format of derived file Leo's Write and Save commands write by default.  If this option is 0 (recommended) Leo writes 4.x format derived files.  Otherwise Leo writes 3.x derived files.

Note that you can use the Write 3.x/4.x Derived Files commands in the File:Read/Write menu to write derived files in an explicitly specified format.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.103">This command deletes all entries in the Recent Files submenu except the most recent file.  The files themselves are not affected, just the menu entries.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.104">The Import Derived File command imports all the nodes in a derived file into the outline.  Unlike the read commands, no outline structure is preserved.  This command can import either 3.x or 4.x derived files.

This command is necessary in version 4.0 because there is no other way to read derived files that are out-of-synch with a .leo file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.105">The Write 4.x Derived Files command and Write 3.x Derived Files command work just like the Write @file Nodes command, except that they write the indicated format off derived file.  In contrast, the Write @file Nodes command writes 3.x format derived files if and only if the write_old_format_derived_files = 1 in leoConfig.txt.

All three of these commands automatically save the outline (the .leo file) if any derived file was actually written.  This is necessary so that information in the .leo file always remains in synch with all derived files.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.106">Paul Paterson contributed the following new plugins:

mod_autosave.py

Autosaves the Leo document every so often.

mod_timestamp.py

Timestamps all save operations to show when they occur.

word_export.py

Exports an outline to a word document.  Clicking "plugins ... word export ... export" exports the selected outline to Word.  Word should be running with an open (empty) document before executing this command.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.107"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.108">Leo's read code now warns if any non-empty node is unvisited.  This check, and the check that headlines match pretty much guarantees that out-of-synch outlines will generate errors.  Thus, there is no need a gnx timestamp in @+leo sentinels!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.109">Version 4.0 is a major advance in Leo's error handling.  Using 4.0 is much safer than all previous versions.  This new error handling applies to all derived files, both 3.x and 4.x format.  

Leo's read code never alters the structure of an outline, regardless of whether read errors are encountered. This means that clone links, marks, and all other information in the outline except body text remains completely unchanged during reads.  Broken clone links (the dreaded read errors) are gone forever.  
Also, the new read code makes no changes to any body text until it is known that no read errors have occured.  This ensures that absolutely no changes at all are made to the outline if there are read errors.

Leo's read code now writes a message to the log pane whenever it sees that the body text in the derived file does not match the body text in the outline.  These messages do not indicate errors, only that the body text has been changed outside of Leo, say in an external editor or by cvs.</t>

</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.172">@nowrap

At startup time Leo looks all files of the form mod_*.py in the plugins
directory. Leo assumes that these files are "plugins" containing Python modules
that customizes Leo's operation. Leo attempts to import each file.

Each module should register routines that are called at various times during
execution. Such times are identified by strings known as "tags". The code in in
one or more plugins corresponding to each tag are known as the "hook" routines
for that tag. Leo catches exceptions (including syntax errors) in hook
routines, so it is safe to hack away on this code.

Leo passes two argument to all hook routines: the tag and a keywords dictionary
containing additional information. For example, keywords["label"] indicates the
kind of command for "command1" and "command2" hooks.

For some hooks, returning anything other than None "overrides" Leo's default
action. Hooks have full access to all of Leo's source code. Just import the
relevant file. For example, top() returns the commander for the topmost Leo
window.

The following table summarizes the arguments passed to hooks: ( Overrides is
"yes" if returning anything other than None overrides Leo's normal command or
event processing.)

Notes:

(1) "activate" and "deactivate" hooks: These have been removed because they do
not work as expected.

(2) "commands" hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
"canonicalized" form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
with all non-alphabetic characters removed.

Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands "undo" and "redo"
rather than "cantundo" and "cantredo".

(3) "menu1" hook: Setting app().realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
translating menu names to other languages. Note: the "new" names created this
way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do _not_ affect how
you specify shortcuts in leoConfig.txt, nor do they affect the "official"
command names passed in app().commandName. For example, suppose you set
app().realMenuNameDict["Open..."] = "Ouvre".

(4) "open1" and "open2" hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing
the following entries:

old_c: The commander of the previously open window.
new_c: The commander of the newly opened window.
fileName: The name of the file being opened.

You can use old_c.currentVnode() and new_c.currentVnode() to get the current
vnode in the old and new windows.

Leo calls the "open1" and "open2" hooks only if the file is already open. Leo
will also call the "open1" and "open2" hooks if: a) a file is opened using the
Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.

(5) "@url1" and "@url2" hooks are only executed if "icondclick1" hook returns None.


New in version 3.12:

The following hooks are a new breed of hook, called "stub hooks". Conceptually,
these hooks are like calls to stub routines that can be filled in by code in
plugins.

Notes:

(6) These hooks are useful for testing.

(7) These stub hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup withing doc
parts, comments and Python """ strings. Note that these hooks are _not_ called
in Python ''' strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of
how to use these hooks.

(8) The "create-optional-menus" stub hook is called when Leo is creating menus,
at the place at which creating new menus is appropriate. Therefore, this hook
need only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the
placement of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu
plugins for examples of how to use this hook. Leo now executes hooks in
alphabetical order, so that the Plugins menu will be created before the Scripts
menu.

(9) The "new" stub hook is called at the beginning of the code that implements
the New command. This provides a much easier way of recognizing when Leo is
about to create a new Leo window.

(10) The "scan-directives" stub hooks is called inside the scanDirectives
global function. The dictionary returned by scanDirectives now contains an item
whose key is "pluginsList". The value of this item is a list of tuples
(d,v,s,k) where:

- d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
- v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
- s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive. k has already
been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
the "scan-directives" stub hook.

(11) The "close-frame" stub hook is called in app.closeLeoWindow just before
removing the window from app.windowList. The hook code may remove the window
from app.windowList to prevent app.closeLeoWindow from destroying the window.

(12) Leo calls the "destroy-all-global-windows" hook in app.destroyAllGlobalWindows().
This hook gives plugins the chance to clean up after themselves when Leo shuts down.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.173">Leo now supports two new stub hooks: "clear-mark" and "set-mark".  Both fully update the marks window, so it is important that they not be called "too often", and they aren't.

As a side effect, it is no longer necessary to update the marks window after every command that affects marks, a nice simplification and generalization of the code.

While I was at it, I moved the two dialog classes used only by the nav_buttons plugin out of leoDialog.py and into nav_buttons.py where they belong.</t>

At present, this plugin supports wiki-style markup, and it would be easy to change the style of markup.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.179">This plugin adds 4 new buttons to the icon area at the top of each Leo window:

- Back and Forward arrows that work like a typical web browser.  Clicking the back arrow button takes you to the last node in the tree you visited.  Clicking the forward arrow button moves you forward.  The forward arrow button is dimmed unless you have clicked the back arrow button recently.

- The Recent button opens a non-modal dialog showing all the nodes you have visited recently.  This dialog is updated cleanly by the tree.select method.  You will see this entries change dynamically.  There are buttons in this dialog for clearing individual entries or clearing all entries.  Double-clicking any entry in this dialog takes you to that node, as does clicking the Go button.

The entries in the Recent Nodes pane do _not_ correspond to the order implied by the Forward and Back arrows.  Rather, the most recently visited node is on top, followed by the next most recently visited node, and so on, with the additional feature that nodes appear only once in the list.

- The Marks button opens a non-modal dialog showing all marked nodes in the tree.  Marking or unmarking nodes in the tree adds or deletes entries from this dialog.  Double-clicking any entry in this dialog takes you to that node, as does clicking the Go button.</t>

leo.py 3.11                         April 27, 2003

This version of Leo contains many important improvements since 3.10,
especially support for unicode and a new plugin architecture.

The Highlights of 3.11:

** Leo supports unicode.
	- New @encoding directives specifies encoding for derived files.
	- New settings specify default encodings for .leo and derived files.
	- Derived files specify encodings used to create them.
** A new plugin architecture for customizing Leo. (A major improvement.)
- New commands:
	- Toggle Angle Brackets.
	- Insert Time/Date (in headline or body text).
	- Go To First/Last Node, Parent, Next/Previous Sibling.
	- Write Missing @file Nodes.
	- Expand/Contract Node.
- Improved commands:
	- Fixed a huge performance bug that slowed moving nodes left.
	- Expand/Contract commands now operate on the selected tree.

leoGlobals.py uses locale.getpreferredencoding to define getpreferredencoding if locale.getpreferredencoding exists (it is new in Python 2.3alpha).  Otherwise, Leo uses the code copied from the 2.3a2 version of Python to define getpreferredencoding.  Either way, leoGlobals.py now defines getpreferredencoding and Leo uses getpreferredencoding rather than getdefaultlocale.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.201">Leo now uses unicode internally for most strings.  This solves a lot of problems.  The children of this node discuss all the details...</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.202">This fixes several bugs.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.203">In particular, the locale returned by locale.getdefaultlocale()[1] need not be a valid unicode encoding.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.204">Leo now uses unicode internally for most strings.  The highlights:

1. Leo converts headline and body text to unicode when reading .leo files and derived files.  Both .leo files and derived files may specify their encoding, with "utf-8" being used by default.  If the encoding used in a derived file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line.  For example:

#@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

The "utf-8" encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all unicode code points), so encoding and decoding to and from utf-8 plain strings will never cause a problem.  When reading or writing a character not in a "lossy" encoding, Leo converts such characters to '?' and issues a warning. 

2. When writing .leo files and derived files Leo uses the same encoding used to read the file, again with "utf-8" used as a default.

3. leoConfig.py contains two settings used to specify the default encoding used for .leo and derived files:

default_derived_file_encoding = UTF-8 
new_leo_file_encoding = UTF-8 

I do not recommend changing new_leo_file_encoding (see the comments in leoConfig.leo) and you may set 
default_derived_file_encoding to anything that makes sense for you.

4. You may use the @encoding directive to specify the encoding used in a derived file.  You can't mix encodings in a single derived file.

This is all should need to know to use extended character sets on Leo.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.205">leoConfig.py now contains two new settings, with the defaults shown below: 

default_derived_file_encoding = UTF-8 
new_leo_file_encoding = UTF-8

I do not recommend changing new_leo_file_encoding (see the comments in leoConfig.leo)

You may set default_derived_file_encoding to anything that makes sense for you.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.206">The following paragraphs discuss code-level details.  You should not need to read this section in order to use Leo.

1. Leo uses unicode objects in vnodes and tnodes to denote headline and body text.  Note that unicode strings have no encoding; only plain strings have encodings. This means that once an (encoded) plain string has been converted to a unicode string it doesn't matter how the unicode string was created.  This is the key that makes Leo's new code robust. 

So internally Leo never has to worry about encodings. The only times encoding matter is when encoded strings are converted to and from unicode when Leo reads or writes files (or when the passing strings to and from Tk.Text widgets, but the idea is the same).

2. Python expressions that mix unicode strings u and plain strings s, like:

	u + s 
or 
	u == s 
or 
	u[5] == s[2:]

are promoted to unicode objects using the "system encoding". This encoding should never be changed, but we can't assume that we know what it is, so for safety we should assume the most restrictive encoding, namely "ascii".  With this assumption, Leo's code can't throw an exception during these promotions provided that: 

- All strings are converted to unicode when Leo reads files or gets text from Tk.Text widgets. 
- All string literals in Leo's code have only ascii characters.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.208">It is now much easier to customize Leo.  The new scheme is based on plugins (files in the plugins directory) rather than modifying customizeLeo.py.  Many thanks to Paul Paterson for suggesting this scheme and for doing the first implementation.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.209">@nocolor

New in 3.11. Leo now looks in the plugins folder for files whose name matches
mod_*.py. Leo tries to import all such files at startup ("start2") time. 

The child of this node gives an example of the code that creates the Open With
menu. The following code, appearing at the end of mod_open_with.py, registers
two different hook functions. The on_idle function is the "idle" hook. The
create_open_with_menu is the "start2","open2" and "command2" hooks.
@color

if 1: # Register the handlers... 
	registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
	registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 
	es("...open with")
	
@nocolor
Plugins may call registerHandler with a hook name like "idle" or a list of hook
names like ("start2","open2","command2"). Also, you can use the "all" hook name
to indicate that code will be called for all hooks. This is useful for tracing
hooks. Plugins may also call registerExclusiveHandler for hooks that should not
be redefined in other plugins.

mod_open_with.py also contains the on_idle and create_open_with functions that
actually handle the hook. Such functions have two arguments: tag and keywords.
You will find many examples of this in LeoPy.leo.

About distribution:

1. LeoPy.leo now contains all the plugins in @ignore'd @file nodes. This way
Leo won't complain when you open LeoPy.leo.

2. Most plugins actually are disabled: the code that registers the hooks is
contained in #if 0: blocks. So to create a plugin you have to remove the
@ignore and you have to change #if 0: to #if 1.

3. Most mod_*.py will never be part of Leo distributions, and the single-click
installer will create an plugins folder containing just mod_open_with.py.

4. There is no longer a need for a customizeLeo.py file.

About error checking:

At present Leo will disable all hooks if any hook throws an exception. In
practice this isn't a big deal, but obviously something better could be done. I
won't do anything until after 3.11b1 goes out.

How to send me your plugins:

It should now be _much_ easier to submit a plugin for inclusion in LeoPy.leo.
Just send me a .leo file containing @file mod_your_plugin.py. Please have this
@file node be @ignored: this is more convenient for me. Ideally, your .leo file
should contain _only_ your plugin code.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.217">Simplified and regularized hooks:

- replaced "event1" and "event2" hooks with 'regular' hooks.
	* Much easier to understand.
- added "iconrclick" hooks.
- added "bodyrclick" hooks.
- added "save1" and "save2" hooks
- added "dragging" hooks.
	* These are called when drag hook called while already dragging.
- added "hyperenter" and "hyperleave" hooks.
	* These only fire if use_hyperlinks = 1 in leoConfig.txt.
- removed "activate" and "deactivate" hooks.
	* These were not reliable.
- almost all hooks now have c,v arguments.
- "command" hooks now return "undo" and "redo" rather than "cantundo" and "cantredo"

Improved code:

- improved the tracing of hooks.
- the tracing code also checks to make sure that most hooks have c,v keywords.
- created es_event_exception().
- put all event handlers in try/except blocks that call es_event_exception on errors.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.218">At startup time Leo looks all files of the form mod_*.py in the plugins
directory. Leo assumes that these files are "plugins" containing Python modules
that customizes Leo's operation. Leo attempts to import each file.

Each module should register routines that are called at various times during
execution. Such times are identified by strings known as "tags". The code in in
one or more plugins corresponding to each tag are known as the "hook" routines
for that tag. Leo catches exceptions (including syntax errors) in hook
routines, so it is safe to hack away on this code.

Leo passes two argument to all hook routines: the tag and a keywords dictionary
containing additional information. For example, keywords["label"] indicates the
kind of command for "command1" and "command2" hooks.

For some hooks, returning anything other than None "overrides" Leo's default
action. Hooks have full access to all of Leo's source code. Just import the
relevant file. For example, top() returns the commander for the topmost Leo
window.

The following table summarizes the arguments passed to hooks: ( Overrides is
"yes" if returning anything other than None overrides Leo's normal command or
event processing.)

Notes:

(1) "activate" and "deactivate" hooks: These have been removed because they do
not work as expected.

(2) "commands" hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
"canonicalized" form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
with all non-alphabetic characters removed.

Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands "undo" and "redo"
rather than "cantundo" and "cantredo".

(3) "menu1" hook: Setting app().realMenuNameDict in this hook is an easy way of
translating menu names to other languages. Note: the "new" names created this
way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do _not_ affect how
you specify shortcuts in leoConfig.txt, nor do they affect the "official"
command names passed in app().commandName. For example, suppose you set
app().realMenuNameDict["Open..."] = "Ouvre".

(4) "open1" and "open2" hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing
the following entries:

old_c: The commander of the previously open window.
new_c: The commander of the newly opened window.
fileName: The name of the file being opened.

You can use old_c.currentVnode() and new_c.currentVnode() to get the current
vnode in the old and new windows.

Leo calls the "open1" and "open2" hooks only if the file is already open.
Leo will also call the "open1" and "open2" hooks if:
a) a file is opened using the Recent Files menu and
b) the file is not already open.

(5) "@url1" and "@url2" hooks are only executed if "icondclick1" hook returns
None.</t>

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;A NAME="anchor127554"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;Summary&lt;/H3&gt;

&lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo is a &lt;i&gt; programmer's editor&lt;/i&gt;  and a flexible &lt;i&gt;browser&lt;/i&gt; for
    projects, programs, classes or data. Leo clarifies design, coding, debugging, testing
  and maintenance.
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo is an &lt;i&gt;outlining editor&lt;/i&gt;. Outlines clarify the big picture while
    providing unlimited space for details.
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo
    is a &lt;a HREF="http://www.literateprogramming.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;literate
    programming&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool, compatible with &lt;A HREF="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/"&gt;noweb&lt;/A&gt;
    and &lt;a HREF="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html"&gt;CWEB&lt;/a&gt;.
    Leo enhances any text-based
programming language, from assembly language and C to Java, Python and XML.
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo is also a &lt;i&gt;data organizer&lt;/i&gt;. A single Leo outline can generate complex
    data spanning many different files.&amp;nbsp; Leo has been used to manage web sites.
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo is a &lt;i&gt; project manager&lt;/i&gt;. Leo provides multiple views
of a project within a single outline. Leo naturally represents tasks that remain
    up-to-date.
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo is fully &lt;i&gt; scriptable&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;A HREF="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/A&gt;
  and saves its files in &lt;A HREF="http://www.w3.org/XML/"&gt;XML&lt;/A&gt; format.
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo is &lt;i&gt;portable&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Leo.py is 100% pure Python and will run on
    any platform supporting &lt;A HREF="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/A&gt;
    and &lt;a href="http://tcl.activestate.com/"&gt;Tk/tcl&lt;/a&gt;, including Windows,
    Linux and MacOS X.&amp;nbsp; Leo.exe runs on any Windows platform.
  &lt;LI&gt;Leo is &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/"&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open Software&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, distributed under
    the &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/doc/Copyright.html"&gt; Python License&lt;/a&gt;.

This version of Leo corrects bugs, improves Leo's documentation and adds many new features:

- Rewrote the Scripting Chapter in Leo's Users Guide.
- Improved the Customization Chapter of the Users Guide.
- Adds several customizations contributed by Leo's users.
  Among these: @read-only nodes. Reading empty .leo files.
  Redirecting stderr and stdout to Leo's log pane.
- New Mark Clones and Go To Next Clone commands.
- New Export Headlines command.
- Control-dragging a node now clones it.
- New "Node Only checkbox in the Find/Change panel.
- @root-code trees start in code mode by default.
  This allows @root trees to work like @file trees.
- @root-doc  trees start in doc  mode by default.
- Converted leoConfig.py to use @root-code
- New at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode option in leoConfig.py.
  Specifies whether @root trees work like @root-code or @root-doc.
- New synonyms: @file-asis = @silentfile
  @file-nosent = @nosentinelsfile ; @file-noref = @rawfile.
- Leo now supports navigation of menus using underlined menus.
- Added an easy way to replace any Leo method by a function.
  The code in customizeLeo.py can now override any part of Leo's code!
- Added routines to redirect stderr and stdout to Leo's log pane.
  These routines can be called from customizeLeo.py.
- Added "event1" and "event2" hooks for customize event handling.
- Improved Leo's window icon, and improved how that icon is loaded.
- The usual assortment of bug fixes and minor improvements.
  Actually, this release fixes more than the usual number of bugs.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.296">New in Leo 3.10:  Leo allows you to choose whether body text in @root trees will start in code mode or doc mode by default.

@root-doc filename and @root-code filename specify that body text is assumed to start in doc mode or code mode respectively.  The options (-doc and -code) must follow @root immediately with no intervening whitespace.  In effect, @root-code and @root-doc are two new directives.

These @root options override the new at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode option in leoConfig.py.  This option affects only @root trees without options.  Such "plain" @root trees are now deprecated, which only means that it is now better style to use either @root-code or @root-doc.  The reason is simple: the meaning of plain @root trees will depend on the at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode option, and that isn't good.

By default, at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode = 1 for compatibility for old @root trees.  I actually don't think this option is good for much; I created it before I created @root-doc and @root-code, and I decided it wouldn't hurt to leave it in.  Anyway, you now have complete flexibility about how @root works, and in particular you can make @root work just like @file.</t>

This is one of the most interesting versions of Leo ever released:

* Major performance improvements:
  - Incremental syntax coloring speeds response when typing.
  - Incremental undo drastically reduces memory used.

* Major improvements in customizing Leo:
  - Leo looks in the file customizeLeo.py for user-specific customizations.
  - Leo calls "hook routines" in customizeLeo.py for all commands and events.
    These hook routines can modify or replace any command or event.
  - New convenience routines simplify creating and modifying menus.
  - Easy translation of menus to other languages using customizeLeo.py.

* Better integration with other tools:
  - The Open With command allows you to communicate back and forth to other editors.
  - The Go To Line Number command converts lines numbers in derived files
    to locations in the outline.
  - Double-clicking the icon of a @url node launches any url in your web browser.
  - The Execute Script command executes Python code in any body pane.
    This is much more convenient than opening Leo's Idle window.
  - Much better support for cweb. At last, Leo has a power user of cweb.
    By default, @space, @* and @** sections are colored as latex text.
    Leo properly generates @q..@&gt; sentinels.
  - @nosentinelfile is like @file except Leo writes no sentinel lines.

* Other improvements:
  - Optional Emacs-style auto-indent.
  - Reformat Paragraph command.
  - Leo will optionally create nonexistent directories specified in
    @file, @root or @path, including all nonexistent parent directories.
  - Leo will place its own icon in Leo windows provided that you have
    installed Fredrik Lundh's PIL and tkIcon packages.
  - The usual assortment of bug fixes.

See the children of this node for full details.

P.S. Here is what Travers A. Hough recently said about Leo:

"When first I opened Leo, it was out of curiosity.  But having used it...I'LL NEVER GO BACK. THEY'LL HAVE TO PRY LEO OUT OF MY COLD, DEAD FINGERS! Seriously, it should be renamed "Crack Cocaine" because it's that addictive. I'm ready to start a 12-Step group."

<t tx="edream.110203163054.311">app().log is now set correctly when there are multiple windows.  Previously, app().log depended on activate events, and was not reliable.  The following routines now set app().log:

- frame.doCommand
- frame.OnMenuClick

Thus, top() will be reliable after any command is executed.  Creating a new window and opening a .leo file also set app().log correctly, so it appears that all holes have now been plugged.

Note: The value of top() may change during a new or open command, which may change the routine used to execute the "command1" and "command2" hooks.  This is not a bug, and hook routines must be aware of this fact.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.312">Leo no longer massages comments when importing Java files.

There was a bug in massageBody that prevented text from being indented properly.  There was a bug in find_line_start (!!) that caused the start of the previous line to be found if s[i] was a newline.  It's amazing that these bugs were undiscovered for so long.

You may customize Leo in several ways:

I.  Using leoSettings.leo

The following information discusses how Leo 4.3 and all later versions handle user configuration settings. For all previous versions, see the node called 'Obsolete: Using leoConfig.leo and leoConfig.txt'

Leo stores options in @settings trees, that is, parts of Leo outlines whose root node has the headline @settings.  When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees in the following places:

- The file called leoSettings.leo in the leo/config directory.
- The file called leoSettings.leo in the users home directory.
- The file being loaded.

Settings that later in the above list override settings found earlier. For example, any setting specified in an @settings tree in the file being loaded overrides any setting seen in any leoSettings.leo file.

II. Using plugins and hooks

During startup, Leo looks for plugins, i.e., .py files in the plugins directory.  These plugins register functions called "hooks" to be called a various times during execution.  Full details are provided below.

Plugins provide the following advantages:

- Any time you see a nice hook handler that someone has written you can just copy it to a plugin file and it runs next time you start Leo.
- You don't have to keep updating a large and growing customizeLeo.py file.
- You can disable and enable hooks by renaming the relevant plugin file.
  (or by enabling or disabling the code in the plugin that registers hook functions).
- You don't have to merge code from hooks pertaining to the same Leo event.

When executing any command or handling any event, Leo calls hook routines registered from the plugin files.  The arguments to hooks are:

- "tag", a string telling the kind of command or event about to be executed, and
- "keywords", a Python dictionary whose keys depend on the specific command or event.

This is a very simple, powerful and general mechanism for customizing Leo as you see fit.  There are dozens of kinds of hooks, including the "command1" and "command2" hooks that are called before and after each of Leo's menu commands.  Leo will allow you to override most commands and event handling.  In many cases, if a hook returns any value except None Leo will assume that the hook has completely handled the command or event and will take no further action.  The details will be explained in full below.

Leo catches all exceptions raised in hook code, so you can modify hooks without worry.

SECURITY WARNINGS: Using hooks naively can create the potential for virus-like behavior.  Please read the section called SECURITY WARNINGS for full details.

III. Using convenience routines called from hooks.

Hook routines can import any file in Leo's source code and execute routines in that file.  Leo's contains a number of convenience routines designed to make common customization tasks easier.  Hooks can use these routines to create your own menus, to translate menus into other languages, and to create entries in the Open With menu.  These convenience routines are discussed in detail below.

IV. Setting app().realMenuNameDict inside hooks to translate menus into other languages.

This is discussed below.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.320">@nocolor

Leo will override settings in .leo files if it finds a file called leoConfig.txt in the config subdirectory.  Leo works just as before if it does not find a leoConfig.txt file.

You should make changes to leoConfig.txt by changing leoConfig.leo and then executing the Tangle All command.  There are two advantages to changing leoConfig.txt in this manner.  First, it is just easier to change leoConfig.leo.  Second, all comments are lost in leoConfig.txt when Leo updates it, so using leoConfig.leo as the primary data file means you will always have the comments available.

Leo looks for leoConfig.txt first in the directory specified by the Python variable sys.leo_config_directory.  You would typically set this variable in Python's sitecustomize.py file.  If this variable does not exist, Leo looks in the directory from which Leo was loaded.

The child of this node contains an example of leoConfig.txt that shows all the options that may be set.

Settings in leoConfig.txt overrides preferences in .leo files, but only for those items actually in leoConfig.txt, so you can choose which settings you want to override.  Also, a Leo ignores any setting in leoConfig.txt whose value is "ignore" (without the quotes). For example:

[prefs panel options]
tab_width = ignore

If a setting is overridden, it is _not_ written to the .leo file when the outline is saved.  Note that this does not change the file format: all previous versions of Leo will be able to read such .leo files.

The preceding is probably all you need to know to use leoConfig.txt.  The following discuss some minor details: 

1. When reading a .leo file, if a setting is found neither in leoConfig.txt nor in the .leo file, Leo uses a default, hard-coded value.  In leo.py 3.0 and later these default settings are found in tables that appear in the section called:

	&lt;&lt; define default tables for settings &gt;&gt;

in the file leoConfig.py. So it is now convenient to change settings in leo.py itself as well as in leoConfig.txt.

2. Leo will update leoConfig.txt unless the read_only option is on in leoConfig.txt.  

WARNING: there are problems when Leo does write leoConfig.txt: all comments are lost and options and sections are written in a random order.  This is due to problems in Python's ConfigParser module and will not be changed any time soon.

3. Provided the read_only option is off, Leo updates leoConfig.txt whenever it saves a .leo file or whenever the Preferences panel is closed without being canceled.  When updating leoConfig.txt, Leo will write only existing settings whose value is not "ignore".

4. When Leo saves a .leo file, Leo will write a Preferences setting to the .leo file only if the setting will not be written when updating leoConfig.txt.  In particular, changes made in the Preferences Panel will become permanent immediately if Leo the read_only option is off.  Otherwise the change will become permanent when any .leo file is saved.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.321">Beginning with version 3.11, you may use plugins to customize how Leo works.  You can

- override or modify any command
- add or customize menus or
- translate menus into any language.

Plugins have full access to all of Leo's source code.  In particular, several convenience methods have been added to make customizing menus and commands easier.

Plugins are permanent: they will not go away when Leo is updated.  You can take
advantage of the latest CVS updates _without_ having to throw away your modifications.

Important warning: plugins must avoid blindly executing scripts in .leo files.  Doing so could expose all parts of your computer to malicious Python code.  The section called "Security warnings and precautions" discusses how to customize Leo safely and how to avoid several pitfalls.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.322">What is a plugin?

A plugin is a .py file that appears in Leo's plugin subdirectory. Leo tries to
import all such files while starting up. This is done at "start1" time, that
is, in the call to doHook("start1") in the run function in leo.py. Plugins
exist to define "hook code".

New in 3.11: Leo looks in the plugins folder for .py files. Leo tries to
import all such files at startup ("start2") time.

New in 4.1: Leo enables only plugins whose name appears in pluginsManager.txt.
Leo loads plugins in the order in which they appear in pluginsManager.txt. Leo
loads no plugins if pluginsManager.txt does not exist in the plugins directory.

What is hook code?

Leo automatically calls hook code at various times during Leo's execution.
Typical hooks are:

- "start2", called at the end of Leo's startup process,
- "command1", called before executing any of Leo's commands
- "idle", called at Tk's idle time, when nothing else is happening,

See the documentation for hooks in this file for full details.

N.B. Plugins can use "start2" hooks to override any of Leo's classes. See
"Overriding functions, methods &amp; classes" in leoPlugins.leo for several
examples of how to do this.

How do plugins work?

Plugins register themselves when Leo imports them using the following code,
which should appear as the outer level of the .py file:

@color

"""A description of this plugin"""

registerHandler("xxx", onXXX)
__version__ = "1.2"
plugin_signon(__name__)
	
@nocolor

Line by line:

1) """A description of this plugin"""

This is a Python doc string describing the plugin. This string becomes the
value of the __name__ attribute for the module (.py file).

2) registerHandler("xxx", onXXX)

This line registers a handler called onXXX for the hook called "xxx". See the
documentation for hooks for a complete list of hook names that you can use
instead of "xxx". onXXX is the name of a function or method, presumably defined
in the plugin file, that Leo will call at "xxx" time. For example:

registerHandler("idle",onIdle)

will cause Leo to call the onIdle function at "idle" time.

You can pass a list of hook names as the first argument to registerHandler. For
example:

registerHandler(("bodykey1","bodykey2","headkey1","headkey2"), onKey)

3) __version__ = "1.2"

This assigns a version attribute to module. At present this attribute is used
by the plugin code that creates Leo's Plugins menu.

4) plugin_signon(__name__)

This line increases the count of loaded modules. The present code for
plugin_signon does not actually print separate signons--it seems to verbose.

About hook handlers

See the "About hooks" section of leoPlugins.leo for full documentation about
how to write hook handler routines, like onXXX or onKey in the examples above.
Basically, each hook should have this pattern:
	
@color

def onXXX (tag,keywords):
	c = keywords.get("c")
	otherKeyword = keywords.get("otherKeyword")
	&lt;&lt; do something with c and otherKeyword, etc. &gt;&gt;
	
@nocolor

In other words, keywords is a Python dictionary containing the keyword
arguments passed to the hook handler. See the See the "About hooks" section of
leoPlugins.leo for a list of the keywords passed to each hook handler.

The tag is the name of the hook. For example, tag would one of
"bodykey1","bodykey2","headkey1","headkey2", for the onKey hook handler in the
example above.

What's next?

It's one thing to know how to create a plugin. It's another to know how to
actually change Leo. Obviously, some study is needed. The place to start your
study is LeoPy.leo. In particular, study very carefully the section called
"Overview of code". Leo is a highly modular program, and Python is ideally
suited to this style of programming.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.323">@nocolor

New in 3.11: Leo looks in the plugins folder for .py files. Leo tries to
import all such files at startup ("start2") time.

New in 4.1: Leo enables only plugins whose name appears in pluginsManager.txt.
Leo loads no plugins if pluginsManager.txt does not exist in the plugins directory.

The child of this node gives an example of the code that creates the Open With
menu. The following code, appearing at the end of mod_open_with.py, registers
two different hook functions. The on_idle function is the "idle" hook. The
create_open_with_menu is the "start2","open2" and "command2" hooks.

@color

# Register the handlers... 
registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 
es("...open with")
	
@nocolor
Plugins may call registerHandler with a hook name like "idle" or a list of hook
names like ("start2","open2","command2"). Also, you can use the "all" hook name
to indicate that code will be called for all hooks. This is useful for tracing
hooks. Plugins may also call registerExclusiveHandler for hooks that should not
be redefined in other plugins.

mod_open_with.py also contains the on_idle and create_open_with functions that
actually handle the hook. Such functions have two arguments: tag and keywords.
You will find many examples of this in LeoPy.leo.

About error checking:

At present Leo will disable all hooks if any hook throws an exception. In
practice this isn't a big deal, but something better could be done.

How to send me your plugins:

It should now be _much_ easier to submit a plugin for inclusion in LeoPy.leo.
Just send me a .leo file containing @file mod_your_plugin.py. Please have this
@file node be @ignored: this is more convenient for me. Ideally, your .leo file
should contain _only_ your plugin code.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.331">Naively using hooks can expose you and your .leo files to malicious attacks.  You will be safe as long as you follow these basic principles:

1. Hooks should _never_ blindly execute Python scripts in .leo files. Blindly executing scripts in .leo files runs the extreme risk of executing malicious code if you ever share any .leo file with someone else.  Moreover, using rexec instead of exec WILL NOT PROTECT YOU.  See the children of this node for further discussion of this important topic.

2. Hooks can execute any code safely _provided_ that all code is contained entirely within the plugin file. If you have a nifty customization that you want to do on a particular .leo file, put that code into a plugin.

3. Use only authentic copies of Leo that come from Leo's SourceForge site.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.332">I'd like to thank Stephen Schaefer for gently insisting that we must guard against malicious code in shared .leo files.  Here is a little story Stephen told on Leo's SourceForge site that makes clear what the danger is:

"I foresee a future in which the majority of leo projects come from marginally trusted sources...I see a world of leo documents sent hither and yon - resumes, project proposals, textbooks, magazines, contracts - and as a race of Pandora's, we cannot resist wanting to see "What's in the box?" And are we going to fire up a text editor to make a detailed examination of the ASCII XML? Never! We're going to double click on the cute leo file icon, and leo will fire up in all its raging glory. Just like Word (and its macros) or Excel (and its macros)."

This succinctly illustrates the fundamental problem: when we share "our" .leo files we can _not_ assume that we know what is our "own" documents.  So hooks that naively searches through .leo files looking for scripts to execute is looking for big trouble.

The following node contains an example of the kind of code that is extremely dangerous.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.333">@color
@ WARNING ***** Using the following routine exposes you to malicious code in .leo files! *****

Do not EVER use code that blindly executes code in .leo files!
Someone could send you malicious code embedded in the .leo file.

WARNING 1: Changing "@onloadpythonscript" to something else will NOT protect
           you if you EVER share either your files with anyone else.

WARNING 2: Replacing exec by rexec below provides NO additional protection!
           A malicious rexec script could trash your .leo file in subtle ways.
@c
if 0: # WRONG: This blindly execute scripts found in an .leo file! NEVER DO THIS!
	def onLoadFile():
		v = top().rootVnode()
		while v:
			h = v.headString().lower()

				s = v.bodyString()

					try: # SECURITY BREACH: s may be malicious!
						exec(s + '\n',__builtins__,__builtins__)
					except:
						es_exception()
			v = v.threadNext()
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.334">@color
@ It would be most foolish to expect rexec to protect you against malicious code contained in .leo files.  Remember that Leo is a repository of source code, so any text operation is potentially malicious.

For example, consider the following script.  This script is valid in rexec mode:
@c

c = top()
thisNode = c.currentVnode()
v = c.rootVnode()
while v:
	&lt;&lt; change all instances of rexec to exec in v's body &gt;&gt;
	v = v.threadNext()
&lt;&lt; delete thisNode &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt; clear the undo stack &gt;&gt;

@ This script will introduce a security hole the .leo file without doing anything prohibited by rexec, and without leaving any traces of the perpetrating script behind.  The damage will become permanent _outside_ this script when the user saves the .leo file.

These convenience methods all do complete error checking and write messages to the log pane and to the console if errors are encountered.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.341">@nocolor
createMenuItemsFromTable (self,menuName,table,openWith=0)

This method adds items to the menu whose name is menuName.  The table argument describes the entries to be created.  This table is a sequence of items of the form (name,shortcut,command).

- name is the command name
- shortcut is the shortcut, or None to indicate no shortcut.
- command is the routine to execute when the menu item is selected.

An entry of the form ("-",None,None) indicates a separator line between menu items.

For example:
@color
table =
	("Toggle Active Pane","Ctrl-T",self.OnToggleActivePane),
	("-",None,None),
	("Toggle Split Direction",None,self.OnToggleSplitDirection))

top().frame.createMenuItemsFromTable("Window",table)

<t tx="edream.110203163054.342">createNewMenu (self,menuName,parentName="top")

This method creates a new menu:

- menuName is the name of the menu to be created.
- parentName is the name of the parent menu, or "top" if the menu is to created in the menu bar.

This method returns the menu object that was created, or None if there was a problem.  Your code need not remember the value returned by this method.  Instead, your code will refer to menus by name.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.343">createOpenWithMenuFromTable (self,table)

This method adds items to submenu of the Open With menu item in the File menu.

The table argument describes the entries to be created.  This table is a sequence of items of the form (name,shortcut,data).

- name is the command name
- shortcut is the shortcut, or None to indicate no shortcut.
- data is a tuple of the form (command,arg,ext)
- command is one of "os.system", "os.startfile", "os.spawnl", "os.spawnv" or "exec".
- arg is an argument to be passed to the given command.
- ext is a file extension or None.

When the user selects the Open With item corresponding to the table item Leo executes command(arg).
If ext is not None, the temp file has the given extension.
Otherwise, Leo computes an extension based on what @language directive is in effect.

For example:

table = (
	("Idle",   "Alt+Shift+I",("os.system",idle_arg,".py")),
	("Word",   "Alt+Shift+W",("os.startfile",None,".doc")),
	("Wordpad","Alt+Shift+T",("os.startfile",None,".txt")))

<t tx="edream.110203163054.348">New in 4.0: Leo can now read and write "foreign" attributes in &lt;v&gt; and &lt;t&gt; elements in .leo files:

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create t.unknownAttributes or v.unknownAttributes ivars for any tnode and vnode object whose corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt; element in the .leo file contains a foreign attribute.

- The unknownAttributes ivars are a dictionary whose keys are the attribute names and whose values are strings.

- When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes if  a vnode or tnode contains an unknownAttributes ivar.

- The only "native" attributes that Leo expects to find are the "tx" attribute in &lt;t&gt; elements and the "a", "t", "vtag" and "tnodeList" attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements.  Everything else is a foreign attribute.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the unknownAttributes ivars.

Plugins may cause Leo to write such foreign attributes simply by attaching unknownAttributes ivars to a vnode or tnode.  For example:

	v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

It would be best not to delete other foreign attributes, so the following would be preferred:

	if hasattr(v,"unknownAttributes"):
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	else:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

Another way:

	try:
		v.unknownAttributes["vnodeIcon"] = pathToIcon
	except AttributeError:
		v.unknownAttributes = {"vnodeIcon" : pathToIcon}

See the section called "Recommended conventions for plugins" for advice about how to avoid potential conflicts in naming new attributes.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.353">The present version should be quite usable for its main purpose: tracking
down lines corresponding to error messages. In particular, except for possible
pathological cases, Leo should always put the cursor in the node containing the
referenced line. Possible pathologies involve asking Leo to "go to" a sentinel
line. It won't always be clear what node contains the sentinel.

I am well aware that Leo may not put the cursor on the proper line within
the vnode, but human beings being the excellent pattern matchers that we are,
we should be easily be able to find a line within a node.

Notes in LeoPy.leo, in the node called (Go to line number), discuss a variety
of issues that may cause the cursor not to go to the "proper" line. It also
discusses a better way to position the cursor.

Internally, there are two main versions of this command: one for @silentfile
trees, and one for @rawfile and @file trees. In the first case, there are no
sentinels in the derived file, so Leo just steps through the outline. This is
the easy case, and should work well. In the second case (@rawfile and @file
trees), the derived file contains sentinels, and Leo uses those sentinels to
determine in what vnode the given line occurs.

In this second case, Leo can almost always position the cursor within the
proper node, because Leo just scans back in the derived file looking for the
proper @+node sentinel. However, in order to "count" lines in the derived file
(to place the cursor properly _within_ the body text) Leo must recreate exactly
the logic used by the atFile.read logic, and that isn't easy. Moreover, there
is _no_ guarantee that the derived file is unchanged from when it was written;
after all, if you get syntax errors you tend to want to fix them ;-)

Please do not report bugs in this command, unless the bug involves a
crash, which would be reported both in Leo's log pane and in the console
window. This command will probably be improved in 3.10.</t>

Leo treats _all_ cweb code in cweb mode as unevaluated text.  That is, Leo treats cweb control codes, including @&lt;...@&gt;, @&lt;...@&gt;=, @c, @space, @* and @** as "raw" text within cweb mode.  Leo does _not_ expand _cweb_ section references when writing derived files in cweb mode.  However, Leo _does_ expand _noweb_ section references, so you may use noweb sections to organize cweb files! You can create _noweb_ code and doc sections using the @code and @doc directives in place of @c and @space directives.

By default, cweb colors @space, @* and @** sections using the same syntax coloring as for LaTeX.  In addition, cweb colors C // and /*..*/ comments using LaTeX coloring by default.  You may change these defaults using the color_cweb_doc_parts_with_latex and color_cweb_comments_with_latex options in leoConfig.py.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.356">The Open With command allows you to communicate with external editor.  When you select this command Leo creates a temporary file and invokes an external program.  Leo periodically checks whether this temporary file has changed; Leo changes the corresponding node in the outline if so.

You must create the entries in the Open With submenu. This would typically be done in a hook routine, using the createOpenWithMenuFromTable routine described in the child of this node.

The @file mod_open_with.py node in LeoPy.leo gives a complete example of handling the Open With menu.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.357">Leo now supports optional Emacs-style auto-indent.  This style of auto-indent aligns newly created lines with unmatched ( [ or { brackets in the previous line. This feature is enabled only if smart_auto_indent = 1 in leoConfig.txt.

This code was contributed by David McNab, david@rebirthing.co.nz.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.358">New in leo.py v3.9

Whether importing text from an outside source, typing in text, or modifying text, eventually you end up with a block of text in which some lines are too long and some are too short.  The Reformat Paragraph command will rearrange the words in a text paragraph to fill each line as full as possible, up to the @pagewidth setting.

A paragraph is delimited by blank lines, Leo directives, and (of course) start and end of text in a node.  The width of the line used by the reformatting operation is governed by @pagewidth and the indentation that would be applied to the node when tangled (as part of a @root) or written (as part of a @file).

The command operates on the paragraph containing the insert cursor.  If the insert cursor is on a blank line or directive, nothing happens.  If the cursor is on a line containing text, then the paragraph containing that text line is reformatted and the insert cursor is moved to the next paragraph.

Be careful that you don't do this on source code!  Of course, if you do reformat something that should have been left alone, then just Undo.

NOTE: Lines with hanging indentation are handled so that the hanging indentation is preserved.  This is most useful for bulleted or numbered lists, such as:

  1. This is the first paragraph, and
     it has a hanging indentation.

  2. This is the second paragraph, and
     it too has a hanging indentation.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.359">An @rawfile tree is a tree whose root headline starts with @rawfile &lt;filename&gt;.  Similarly, for @silentfile and @nosentinelsfile trees.

Leo creates files derived from @file and @nosentinelsfile trees in exactly the same way.  The _only_ difference is that files derived from @file trees contain sentinels, while files derived from @nosentinelsfile trees do not.  Therefore, Leo can not update outlines from changed made from files derived from @nosentinelfile trees.

Leo creates files derived from @rawfile and @silentfile trees by writing the body text of all nodes of the tree in outline order.  Leo writes the body text _as is_, without recognizing section definitions, without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way.  In particular, Leo copies all directives, including @space or @c directives, to the derived file as text. However, Leo recognizes the @ignore directive in the _ancestors_ of @rawfile or @silentfile nodes, so you may use the @ignore directive as usual to prevent Leo from writing @rawfile and @silentfile trees.

There are several difference between @rawfile and @silentfile trees:

1. Leo writes no sentinel lines when writing @silentfile trees.  When writing @rawfile trees, Leo writes only the @+leo, @-leo, @+node, @-node, @+body and @-body sentinels. Therefore, Leo can update @rawfile trees, but _not_ @silentfile trees from changes made in derived files. Unlike @file and @rawfile trees, the primary source of information for an @silentfile tree is the outline containing it.

2. Within @silentfile trees only, if a headline starts with @@, Leo writes everything in the headline following the @@ just before the corresponding body text.

3. Files derived from @silentfile trees contain _nothing_ not contained in body text (or @@ headlines).  In particular, if body text does not end in a newline, the first line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the preceding node.

In short, you can get any combination of sentinels/no sentinels and references/no references using @file, @nosentinelsfile, @rawfile and @silentfile trees.  This is shown in the following table:

                     Derived files        Sections and 
    Type of tree   contain sentinels?   @others expanded?
    ------------   ------------------   -----------------
           @file   yes                  yes
@nosentinelsfile   no                   yes
        @rawfile   yes                  no
     @silentfile   no                   no

New in Leo 3.10:

@file-asis is a synonym for @silentfile.
@file-nosent is a synonym for @nosentinelsfile.
@file-noref is a synonym for @rawfile.

Many major improvements have been made to Leo, all made as the result of user requests:

- New @rawfile and @silentfile trees complement @file trees.
  @rawfile and @silentfile trees create derived files without using sections.
  @rawfile files contain only those sentinels needed to automatically untangle them.
  @silentfile trees contain no sentinels at all.
- New @raw and @end_raw directives allow unformatted code within @file trees.
- Much better support for CWEB.  You may organize .w files using noweb!
- The @comment and @language directives may now apply simultaneously.
- Leo can now read, remember and write &lt;?xml-stylesheet...?&gt; lines,
  under control of the new stylesheet option.
- The new output_newline option specifies the line endings used when writing files.
- The new output_initial_comment option specifies the text to appear
  in an @comment sentinel at the start of each derived file.
- New commands in the help menu make it much easier to change configuration options.
- Dozens of minor improvements and bug fixes.

This month Dave Hein and I discovered how to uniquely and permanently identify nodes, regardless of where those nodes are located and regardless of how many people are working simultaneously on them.  This discovery will greatly improve Leo, and will simplify how people use Leo with CVS.  Leo 4.0, due out in a month or two, will be the first version of Leo to use this breakthrough.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.382">The @raw and @end_raw directives delimit a region of "raw" text.  No section references are recognized within "raw" text, and no additional leading whitespace is generated within "raw" text when writing the derived file.

The @quiet directive is valid only within @root trees.  It suppresses all sentinels except the @+node sentinels used to mark headlines.

See the children of this node for full details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.383">The @raw and @end_raw directives are valid only within @file trees.  The @raw directive starts a section of "raw" text.

No section references are recognized within "raw" text, and no additional leading whitespace is generated within "raw" text when writing the derived file.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.384">The @verbose, @terse, @quiet and @silent directives determine how the Tangle command outputs comments in @root trees.  Comments written by the user in code sections are always output: these directives control only: a) the comments containing doc sections and b) sentinel comments that delimit the beginning and end of code sections.

When @verbose is in effect Tangle outputs all comments. When @terse is in effect, Tangle outputs only those comments necessary for Untangle to work. When @silent is in effect Tangle adds no additional comments.  The @quiet directive is like @silent except that it does output leading sentinels as comments. Like @silent, @quiet inhibits untangling. 

@verbose is the default. If more than one of these directives appear in the same body text the "most verbose" of these options will be in effect.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.385">It is now possible to create CWEB (.w) files from @file trees.  When @language cweb is in effect the following happen:

3. Leo uses @q@ and @&gt; for comment delimiters in files derived from @file or @rawfile trees, and Leo replaces @ by @@ within such comments.

4. Leo now properly warns about orphan nodes when @langauge cweb was in effect.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.402">Recently I have discovered a way of creating true, immutable global identifiers (called global tnode indices or gti's for short).  Version 4.0, due late this year or early next, will be the first version of Leo to take full advantage of the opportunities created by gti's.

Gti's will be a way of permanently and uniquely identifying every node (headline and body text) ever created by Leo, even when many people are working on the same .leo and derived files.  For the first time, Leo will be able reliably to associate nodes in .leo files with nodes in derived files.

No previous version of Leo, including 3.7, has this ability, although that may not be so apparent to the casual user.  As a work around in all previous versions of Leo, .leo files contain copies of all information in derived files.  This "mirroring scheme" is needed so that clones in .leo files can be associated with their cloned counterparts in derived files.

While the mirroring scheme usually works well, it has some significant problems:

1. .leo files are much larger than they need to be.

2. Read errors occur if the derived files get out-of-synch with the information in the .leo file.  All clone links get broken when read errors occur, which basically ruins the resulting .leo file.  The only real way to recover is to use the Read Outline Only command.

3. Because out-of-synch conditions are so serious, it becomes a dicey proposition to save .leo files as backups; to create a reliable backup one must save the leo file along with all derived files.

Gti's solve all these problems:

1. .leo files no longer need to save a copy of all information in all derived files.  Leo will write only the root node of @file trees to the outline, secure in the knowledge that it can reliably recreate the outline from the derived file.

2. The dreaded read errors will be impossible because there is no longer any data in the .leo file that can become out-of-synch with data in the derived files.

3. Because .leo files can never become out-of-synch with derived files, we can, for the first time, safely backup a project by creating a "fat" .leo file that contains all information in all derived files.  Most .leo files will be "thin."  Saving "fat" .leo files will only happen as the result of a new Save Backup
command. 

I am excited about Leo 4.0.  It promises to revolutionize how people use Leo.</t>

Many improvements have been made to Leo.  The highlights:

- Now works with Python 2.1.  Previous versions required Python 2.2.
- Many new user options, including user-definable shortcuts for all commands
  and colors for all parts of Leo's windows.
  As a result, it is now possible to use arrow keys as you desire.
- Minimal support for Unicode Latin-1 (iso-8859-1) encoding. Better support is coming.
- Improved handling of relative path names.
- The @first directive allows lines to precede the opening @+leo sentinel line.
- The @last  directive allows lines to follow  the closing @-leo sentinel line.
- Better support for Perl+pod.
- Leo now ends all lines with '\n' regardless of platform.
- Leo is now compatible with Python 2.1.
- Simplified sentinels reduce spurious CVS diffs.
- Many other minor improvements and bug fixes.

Warning: Leo expects that all characters in derived files and .leo files are contained in the encoding specified by the xml_version_string option in leoConfig.txt.  Characters will be garbled if this restriction is not followed.  This restriction will be removed in the next release.

This was wrong, as extra @+node sentinels are often generated when no body text is generated. The result is

<t tx="edream.110203163054.432">Leo checks all characters that are entered (via typing or via paste) into headline and body text to see whether they can be represented in the encoding specified by the xml_version_string setting in leoConfig.txt.  Leo issues a message and disallows the entry of the character if it can't be represented in that encoding.

This draconian behavior shouldn't be too much of a nuisance, at least temporarily. Note that _all_ characters are valid in the UTF-8 encoding, so the present version of Leo will allow you to specify all characters if you must. But the Latin-1 (iso-8859-1) encoding, being a one-byte encoding, limits you to at most 256 separate characters. 

In 3.8 I plan to allow you to use all Unicode characters, regardless of encoding, by using character references.  This will require some reorganization of the present code, and I don't want to delay 3.7 to handle them.

Warning: The present code does not handle well files (.leo or derived files) that contain characters outside the specified encoding.  At present, your best bet is to remove such characters for now.  Hopefully 3.8 will do a much better job handling characters "foreign" to the specified encoding.</t>

The changes:

1. Eliminated writing clone indices in derived files.  This reduces the number of spurious changes reported by CVS.  Leo now relies solely on information in .leo files to recreate clone indices.  This is safe because read errors clear clone indices anyway.  You can force clone indices to be written using the write_clone_indices user option in leoConfig.txt.

2. Removed extra newline following @+leo directive.  This is part of an unfinished plan to eliminate all extra blank lines in derived files.  It's not clear whether this plan will ever succeed.</t>

Highlights:

- Fixed a large number of bugs, especially bugs that appear only on Linux.
- Leo now remembers the previous insertion point and location of the scrollbar when switching between nodes.
- Added Match Brackets command.
- Added support for MouseWheel (Linux only).
- Added support for LaTex and PHP.
- Improved all aspects of the Help menu.
- Discovered a minor bug involving the Python (Idle) window and documented a workaround.

See the children of this node for full details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.444">The following minor bug can not easily be fixed because it involves an interaction between Leo and Idle.

After opening Idle with the Open Python Window command, opening another Leo window shows both the Leo window and a blank, square window.  Closing either of the new windows may cause exceptions, either immediately or later.

The best workaround is simply not to open any new Leo windows after using the Open Python Window command.</t>

This command looks for the matching character, searching backwards through the body text if the cursor is next to ) ] } or &gt; and searching forward through the text otherwise.  If the cursor is between two brackets the search is made for the bracket matching the leftmost bracket.

If a match is found, the entire range of characters delimited by the brackets is highlighted and the cursor is placed just to the left of the matching characters.  Thus, executing this command twice highlights the range of matched characters without changing the cursor.</t>

- Type the following in the Python window:

import leoImport

This release contains many small improvements and bug fixes.  The highlights:

- Fixed several crashers involving Unicode.
- The Show Invisibles command now makes blanks and tabs look much better.
- Created leoConfig.leo, from which leoConfig.txt is now derived.
- Added save_clears_undo_buffer configuration option.
- Fixed a large number of problems with the configuration code.
- The usual minor improvements and bug fixes.

See the children of this node for full details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.481"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.482">The problem is that the ratio is saved in the .leo file and the split direction is not. So if leoConfig.txt is read-only you the Toggle Split Direction command will permanently change the body-outline ratio _without_ permanently changing the split direction itself.

This basically sucks, and here are my reasons: 

1. I do not want to be adding more options to .leo files; the whole idea of leoConfig.txt is to move in the opposite direction. 

2. You can make everything work more like you would expect by making leoConfig.txt read-write. 

3. Especially in the case of the split direction, I expect people to have strong preferences one way or the other, so even if leoConfig.txt is read-only it shouldn't be too odious to pick a split direction and live with it.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.483">The undo buffer creates a lot of strings.  On some system this may be a problem.  If save_clears_undo_buffer = 1 the Save command (and only the Save command) will clear the undo buffer.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.484">The new spelling is to limit_directory_search_extension.  Note that this affects the valid entries in leoConfig.txt.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.485">This allows us to create leoConfig.txt more easily, and provides a safe place to permanently store comments when read-write mode is on.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.486">If a setting was missing or "ignore" it could never be set!  This no doubt could have caused a wide variety of symptoms.  In particular, in the distributed leoConfig.txt file it meant that settings for "default" fonts and sizes were never updated!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.487">The new code properly deletes previous entries regardless of case or path separators.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.488">There were a couple of bugs here.

Note that the ratio (whichever the direction) is stored in the .leo file.  The initial_splitter_orientation setting in leoConfig.txt applies to _all_ files.  The initial_vertical_ratio and the corresponding initial_horizontal_ratio  apply only to new files, so are essentially useless.

Yes, this is pretty stupid; it's the result of not wanting to add more stuff to Leo's file format.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.493">leo.py 3.1 contains Python code that may be of interest to some Python programmers.  All Python files are derived from LeoPy.leo.

See the children of this node for details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.494">This script does much of the grunt work of converting from C/C++ syntax to Python syntax.  It was surprisingly effective in converting Leo from C++ to Python.  These scripts don't need to be perfect to save a _lot_ of work.  And of course you can always add your own improvements...

As written, the script converts an entire Leo tree.  It would be easy to write an entry that would convert plain text files, but it's probably best to import the files to be converted into Leo first.  That way the slow algorithms in c2py.py will work on smaller pieces of text.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.495">This code gathers and prints static statistics about Python bytecode.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.496">The file leoUtils.py contains some small Tkinter utilities:

w,h,x,y = get_window_info(top) returns the width, height, x and y positions of the Tkinter window top.

center_dialog(top) centers the Tkinter window top on the screen.

w,f = create_labeled_frame(parent...) creates a labeled Tkinter window as a child of parent.  The caller packs widgets into f to create the frame.

leoUtils.py contains many other routines including an Python version of the Sherlock tracing package.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.497">leoFontPanel.py puts up a Font dialog.  This dialog dispenses with the typical "sample" pane and instead changes text immediately directly on the screen.  Comes with Ok, Cancel and Revert buttons.  IMO, this dialog is much better than the sample Tk/Tkinter font dialogs available on the web.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.498">leoColor.py contains code to syntax color Tk.Text widgets for a variety of languages.  Supporting a new language here is mostly a matter of adding another table of keywords.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.499">Leo supports powerful outlining features, including clones.  Clones are challenging to implement, to say the least.  The vnode and tnode classes, defined in leoNodes.py, represent the underlying data.  vnodes represent nodes on the screen.  vnodes may share text, the tnode class is the "unit of sharing" of such text.  The leoTree class draws the tree and handles events, including dragging nodes around the screen.  The Commands class calls the vnode, tnode and leoTree classes to handle menu commands.  In Smalltalk's model/view/controller terminology, the vnode and tnode classes are model class, the leoTree class is a view class, and the Commands class is a controller class.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.500"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.501">Now at last it is clear why Leo hasn't been writing derived files affected by clones.  It's not enough to mark v dirty.  We must mark all the cloned nodes of v's tree dirty as well.

However, we only need do this when a node is deleted, and we definitely do _not_ want to do this otherwise, for that would mark far too many nodes dirty.  To get around this, we leave v.setDirty() as it was, and use the new code only in v.setDirtyDeleted.

Note that the undo and redo cases handle this automatically because they call c.doDelete.

So now we can state a rule that should not ever be broken: after doing a Save command, a Write @file Nodes command should always report "unchanged" for all files.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.502"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.503">Added setRevertVars to update revert settings.  This is called from __init__ and onOk.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.504">Changed idle_body_key and idle_head_key, leoTangle::os and tnode::setTnodeText.

We must remove backticks from messages that might contain unicode characters so they will print properly.  There were only a few instances, and they are all error messages that hardly ever get executed, so I hope I was careful putting them in.  I should be able to find them all by looking for '"'.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.505">Repeated double-clicking (without intervening single-click) caused the selection to move to the left.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.506"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.507"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.508">This is consistent with what the Import commands do for the other file types.  It's also much safer.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.509"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.510">This makes selected text look much better and makes Show Invisibles look much better as well.  

This was not easy to do.  Apparently tag settings interfere with the Tk.Text settings.  I have not found a way to specify the selectbackground color for tags.  The only way I could get things to work is define whitespace tags only when in showInvisibles mode.</t>

This version of Leo:

- Added support for Unicode.
- Improved the Import commands.
- Fixed numerous bugs related to configuration settings.
- Fixed the "Javadoc" bug and several latent bugs related to it.

See the children of this node for details.

Edward K. Ream</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.513">It is now possible to use non-Ascii characters in Leo!

Leo uses the xml_version_string setting to encode Unicode characters in .leo files.  This will be UTF-8 by default.  I've also very briefly tested ISO-8859-1.

I am a complete Unicode ignoramus.  It seemed trivial to add Unicode support to Leo, and if there are any fine points that should have been considered I no doubt did not consider them...</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.514">The Import command now does a better job of removing excess leading whitespace.

When importing .java files, Leo now preserves newlines in leading block comments.  This makes the typical weird Java comments look better.  For example,

/**  This is a typical,
  * brain-dead,
  * Java comment.
  */

Now gets rendered as

@ * This is a typical
 * brain-dead,
 * Java comment.
@c

The comment will be reconstituted properly when rewritten.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.517">- Negative tab widths are now honored properly.

- Made 'additional_body_text_border' setting functional.

- There was a bug that made the following non-functional.

	"read_only"
	"xml_version_string"
	"limit_count"
	"body_pane_wraps"

That is, only the default settings in leoConfig.py were used, not the settings in leoConfig.txt.

- The old code did not use the "page_width" and "tab_width" settings from leoConfig.txt.</t>

This version generalizes the @others directive, improves the Import command and fixes several bugs.  See the children of this node for full details.

The highlights:

- Nested @others directives are now valid, an important improvement.
  This simplifies files that define more than one class.
- Improved the Import command and squashed several bugs lurking there.
- Made the various Go commands in the Outline-Move/Select menu functional
  by reassigning keyboard shorts
- Fixed a crasher in the Prefs Panel.
- Fixed numerous bugs in the Set Colors command.
- Fixed syntax coloring of C strings that span multiple lines.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.519">Nested @others directives are now valid, even when no named node intervenes.  This is a significant enhancement to Leo because it is now easier to define multiple classes in a single file.  The leoNode.py file also uses nested @others directives.

The outline shown in the child of this node shows the general idea.

The Import command uses nested @others to great effect in Python files containing many classes.  For example, try importing the file Python/Lib/Compiler/ast.py.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.520">@color

# This is the "outer" @others
@others

	# This is an "inner" @others.  No named node intervenes.
	@others</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.522">def one():

<t tx="edream.110203163054.527">The Import command creates nested @others directives when parsing Python classes.

Fixed two bugs in the Import command:

1. The Import command now properly places the first @others directive of Python files.  Previously the @others directive was placed before section references, so code could be rearranged.

2. The Import command now properly handles all C preprocessor directives.  Previously there were problems handling the #ifndef directive which could ruin imports.

Two other minor improvements:

1. This is reasonable: we don't wan't people generating files from imported files unless they take some positive action.

2. The Import command now checks that different branches of #if, #else, #endif directives have the same net number of braces, and warns if they do not.  This logic was inserted while trying to fix bug #2 above.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.528">It's too confusing to have arrow keys mean different things in different panes.

For one thing, we want to leave the focus in the body pane after the first click in the outline pane, but that means that the arrow keys must still be functional in the body pane!

Alas, all the various combinations of key bindings of arrow keys appear to do something; there are none left to use for moving around in the outline pane.  So we are stuck with poor shortcuts.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.529">Leo could sometimes crash when the user selected Cancel in the Preferences panel.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.530"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.531">There were too many problems in the old color panel.

- Completely revised the Revert logic in the main Color panel.
- The color name picker now reverts properly.
- Color names and color swatches are now properly updated in all cases,
  so there is no need to write color values to the log window.
- Eliminate quotation marks around color names and values.
- The color picker now shows the value of the present color, not the revert color.
- Increased the width of name buttons to handle long color names.

This version fixes a blunder that affects only leo.py 3.0.  I recommend that all users of 3.0 upgrade to this version.

With this release Leo's to-do list is now empty! I shall fix bugs as they are reported. I'll add new features only if convinced that they contribute significantly to Leo.

The highlights:

- Fixed a blunder: Leo 3.0 did nothing when it was opened directly from leo.py.
  (Opening leo using openLeo.py did work.)
- Created a compare panel to control scripts in leoCompare.py.
- Added many new settings in leoConfig.txt to initialize the compare panel.
- The FAQ tells how to add support for new languages.
  (These instructions also appear in the "Notes/How To" section in LeoPy.leo)
- The usual minor improvements and bug fixes.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.537">The new rules allow leo.py 3.1 to read and write .leo files more like leo.py 2.x when there is no leoConfig.txt file.  The scheme used in leo.py 3.0 meant that preferences were _never_ written to .leo files.  It's advantage was that all defaults were specified in:

	leoConfig.&lt;&lt; define default tables for settings &gt;&gt;

I think the present scheme is more natural, but we shall see...

In effect, Leo sets and gets various options in the following order of precedence:

1. Use explicit settings in leoConfig.txt if they exist.

2. Use defaults for leoConfig.txt, but only if leoConfig.txt exists.  These defaults are found in:

	leoConfig.&lt;&lt; define default tables for settings &gt;&gt;

3. Use settings in .leo files if leoConfig.txt does not exist.

4. If leoConfig.txt does not exist, and the .leo file does not specify a setting, use hard-coded settings in the various classes, just as leo.py 2.x did.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.538">The @pagewidth, @tabwidth and @language directives could not have worked while tangling. Apparently nobody has every used these directives in @root trees!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.539">The Flatten Outline command must use an escape convention so that it can distinguish between the "+" and "-" characters that denote a headline and any "+" and "-" characters that start a line of body text.

The old version of Flatten Outline inserted a backspace before _all_ "+", "-" and backspace characters.  The new version of Flatten Outline inserts a backspace before such characters only if they are the first non-whitespace character of a line.

This change affects the "file format" used by the Import Flattened Outline command.  If you import a file flattened with the old version of Flatten Outline, the new Import Flattened Outline will remove the inserted backspace only if it is the first non-whitespace character of the line.  In practice, this is unlikely to be a problem: you could just manually convert "\\", "\+" and "\-" to "\", "+" and "-" throughout the imported file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.540">The Open Python Window command now attempts to add IDLE's location to sys.path if import idle fails.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.542">leo.py 3.0                                     July 16, 2002

This version is called 3.0 because it can optionally produce files that can NOT be read by the leo.py 2.x or the Borland version of Leo.  However, by default, leo.py 3.0 DOES produce files that all previous versions of Leo can read.

See the children of this node for full details.  The highlights:

- Support for many user options stored in leoConfig.txt, including, among others,
  fonts in all panes, colors for syntax coloring and default window size and position.
- Support for .leo files with XML types like "ISO-8859-1", controlled by a user option.
  Note: by default, Leo writes files compatible with previous versions of Leo.
- Powerful new Color and Font pickers, fully connected to user options.
- Added Toggle Split Direction command, under control of user options.
- Added autoscrolling in the outline pane.
- Windows open at the position in which they were saved.
- The size and position of new windows can be controlled with user options.
- Eliminated drawing problems while opening files.
- Improved syntax coloring for @comment plain.
- The Convert All Blanks and Convert All Tabs commands are now undoable.
- Leo warns and aborts if Python 2.2 or above is not running.
- The usual bug fixes.

At least one more version of leo.py is planned.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.543">You now have a choice: you can configure Leo to please previous versions of Leo or to please XML parsers:

Leo now uses the xml_version_string configuration setting, if present, to override the UTF-8 setting used in all previous versions of Leo.  The default value of this setting is UTF-8, so by default leo.py will write files that may be read by any previous version of leo.py or the Borland version of Leo.

However, xml_version_string = ISO-8859-1 will produce .leo files that are more acceptable to XML parsers when those .leo files contain Unicode characters that are not found in the UTF-8 (Ascii) character set.  In any event, the choice of whether to please previous versions of Leo or XML parser is completely up to you. 

If the setting does not exist, whatever value is present in the .leo file will be written when the .leo file is written.  For new files, a value of UTF-8 will be used when this setting is not present.

Notice that this also affects what is written to the clipboard.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.544"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.545">This version supports many more options than before.  See leoConfig.txt for the full list.

Leo looks for leoConfig.txt in the same places as in leo.py 2.5.  If Leo does not find leoConfig.txt, This version will use defaults specified in tables defined in the section
	&lt;&lt; define default tables for settings &gt;&gt;
in leoConfig.py.  So it is now convenient to change settings in leo.py itself as well as in leoConfig.txt.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.546">Including the split direction and split ration.

Leo now uses all configuration settings from leoConfig.txt.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.547">If you drag a headline above or below the outline pane the outline pane will scroll automatically.  As before, Leo will cancel the drag if you release a headline anywhere but over another headline's icon.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.548">You can specify colors for each syntax coloring construct using a color wheel or by choosing one of the standard Tk color names.  When a color becomes active Leo writes its value or color name to the log pane for your reference.  This is useful when setting coloring options in leoConfig.txt.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.549">Using this panel should be self-explanatory (what you see is what you get) with the following exceptions:

1.  When a font becomes "active", the new font appears in the panes whose check boxes are selected.  A font becomes active when you double-click its name, or check or uncheck any checkbox.

It would be much better to have a font become active if you just select its name.  Alas, that is not possible due to a well-known gap in the Tk.Listbox class.

2. Font sizes must be greater than 0 and less than 100 for them to become in effect.

3. Choosing very _small_ values for font sizes may cause Leo's window to _expand_ its width.

4. When you choose OK or Cancel Leo writes the fonts presently active in each pane to the log pane for your reference.  This is useful when setting font options in leoConfig.txt.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.550">This was a supremely irritating bug.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.551">This command switches between vertical and horizontal orientations of the Leo window.  In the vertical orientation, the body pane appears below the pane containing the outline and log panes.  In the horizontal orientation, the body pane appears to the left the pane containing the outline and log panes.

leoConfig.txt specifies the default direction.  If leoConfig.txt does not exist, or does not specify the direction, the "vertical" orientation is used, just as in previous versions.

By default, the ratio of pane outline pane to the body pane is 0.5 in the vertical orientation and 0.3 in the horizontal orientation.  These two ratios may be changed using leoConfig.txt.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.552">The @comment directive no longer suppresses syntax coloring.  Leo directives (but not doc parts) are colored when @language plain is in effect.  The user can, as always, suppress all coloring by using @nocolor.  The new rules are much more natural than the old, and much less confusing.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.553"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.554"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.555">The old colorer colored all Leo directives blue, the same color as keywords in whatever language is current. I think the distinction between Leo directives and language keywords is useful.  Of course, you can control syntax coloring yourself by altering leoConfig.txt.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.556">This message is printed to the console, not the log pane.  On windows, this may not always be visible.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.557">Leo will convert underscores in the @comment directives to significant spaces.  For example,

@comment REM_

causes the comment delimiter to be "REM " (Note the trailing space).</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.558"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.559">This happened sometimes when using @comment.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.560">Leo directives were mostly being colored using the colors for keywords.  This didn't show up because both were colored blue.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.561">Only one window now appears when opening a .leo file, and the window is completely drawn before anything gets written to the log pane.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.562">Added new code for Convert All Blanks and Convert All Tabs.

Fixed a bug that resulted in Convert Tabs being undoable.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.563">This makes the panel much more convenient to use.</t>

2.5.1 This version corrects crashers that affect undo/redo move commands.
Version 2.5 has been withdrawn.
Anyone using 2.5 should use 2.5.1 instead.

This is a major step forward to completing leo.py.  It adds significant new features and corrects many bugs.  Full details are found in the children of this node.  Here are the highlights, in approximate order of importance:

1. Leo supports tab widths properly, and negative tab widths cause Leo to convert tabs to blanks as you type.  Three new commands appear in the Edit Body menu: Convert Tabs, Convert All Tabs and Convert All Blanks.  Convert All Tabs and Convert All Spaces convert the entire selected tree.

2. Leo now allows you to override selected preferences using a configuration file called leoConfig.txt. Leo acts as before if this file does not exist.  An option in leoConfig.txt specifies whether leoConfig.txt is read-only.

3. The Preferences panel is now a modal dialog containing Ok, Cancel and Revert buttons.  This makes it clear what preferences are being set.

4. At long last, cut and paste work properly in all situations.  You can cut and paste between Leo and other applications, or between two different copies of Leo.

5. Added the Recent Files submenu to the File menu.  Very nice to have.

6. Fixed a number of bugs, including several crashers.  Fixed several bugs in the Import commands.  Leo will no longer abort reading if it detects an invalid directory name in the Default Tangle Directory in the Preferences panel.

leo.py is almost complete.  The only remaining tasks on my list are:

1. Make the Set Font... and Set Colors... commands functional.  This will be easy now that leoConfig.txt exists.
2. Fix the Javadoc bug.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.566">The following are listed in the approximate order of their importance.  The marked nodes are particularly important.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.572">The Preferences panel is now a modal dialog.  This solves a number of problems, both for the implementation and for the user.  It is now completely clear which preferences are being set, viz., the preferences for the window on top.  In addition, the Prefs panel now shows the name of the window whose preferences are to be set.

The Prefs panel now contains OK, Cancel and Revert buttons.  These are useful, and they are possible only because we have a modal dialog.</t>

import sys # This line becomes an orphaned node
class C:
    xyz = 'xyz' # This line becomes an orphaned node
    def __init__(self):
        pass

3. Importing a Python file containing classes without methods resulted in nested classes. There is still a minor problem:  The following

class A:
	pass

puts the "pass" in a section called &lt;&lt; class A declarations &gt;&gt;.  This is not easy to fix: you will have to correct it by hand.

4. Improved the Import to @root command.  Added @root &lt;filename&gt; to the body text of the root of tree and eliminated @language and @others directives.</t>

This version fixes some annoying bugs and adds some nice features.  The children of this node contain full details.

1. Leo now properly highlights the headline of a newly created node.  Similarly, the Edit Headline command (control-H) now works.  Double-clicking in a headline now does what you would expect: it selects the word under the cursor.  Similarly, triple-clicking now selects the entire headline.  Also fixes several other minor bugs.

2. Drag and drop.  You can now reorganize outlines by dragging nodes around.  You must drag from a node's headline and release on another node's headline.  See a child of this node for complete details.

3. You can now open .leo files in leo.py by double clicking on .leo files.  You must associate leo.py with .leo files.  See a child of this node for detailed instructions about how to do this.

4. Improves error recovery when there are errors writing .leo files.

5. Updates this file to match the documentation of Leo's web site.  At long last, Leo's documentation is complete.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.592">1. Fixed a bug in app.finishCreate that caused Leo to take an exception on MacOS X.

2. Leo now properly highlights the headline of a newly created node.  Similarly, the Edit Headline command (control-H) now works properly.

3. Removed a useless assert in st_enter_root_name that could fail under unusual circumstances.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.593">When writing a .leo file, say f.leo, Leo now attempts to create a backup file called f.leo.back.  If there is an error while writing f.leo, Leo will restore f.leo from f.leo.back.  Note that Leo will write derived files correctly even when there is an error writing the .leo file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.594">New in leo.py v2.4: You may drag an node (including all its descendents) from one place to another in an outline.  To start a drag, press the main (left) mouse button while the cursor is over the icon for a node.  The cursor will change to a hand icon. If you release the mouse button while the hand cursor is above the icon for another node, Leo will move the dragged node after that node.  If you release the mouse button when the hand cursor is not over an icon, Leo will print "not moved" and leave the outline pane as it is.  This can result in the dragged node not being visible on the screen, but it seems less alarming not to force the current node to become visible as that would undo any scrolling that has just been done.

New in leo.py 3.0: If you drag outside the outline pane, the outline pane will scroll automatically.

Leo scrolls the outline pane as the result of mouse-moved events, so to continue scrolling you must keep moving the mouse.  I experimented with scrolling the outline pane whenever the cursor is dragged outside it, but the results were not good.  There was a noticeable delay between releasing the cursors and halting the scrolling.  The present code is simpler and more likely to work on all platforms.

Leo only allows dragging from one icon to another.  In particular, you can't move a node to the first child of another node unless that node is already expanded.   I experimented with automatically open nodes when the cursor moves over an unexpanded node with children.  However, this was confusing and alarming.  It seems best to expand and contract nodes explicitly.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.595">leo.py version 2.3                             June 5, 2002

This version fixes a minor problem with Leo.

1.  The code that reads and writes @file nodes now uses the directory containing the .leo file as a default when the Default Tangle Directory setting is empty in the Preferences panel.  This is a reasonable default because derived files are most often created in the same directory as the .leo file.  BTW, the Tangle and Untangle commands have used this convention for a long time.

Note: This default allows us to distribute LeoPy.leo without specifying a directory in the Preferences Panel.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.596">leo.py version 2.2                             June 1, 2002

The version fixes two bugs that happen rarely and can cause loss of data when they do happen.

1.  In certain circumstances leo.py v2.1 would delete most of an outline when a node was moved in front of the previous root node!

2.  All previous versions of leo.py will crash when saving body text containing unicode characters.  This could occur as the result of cutting and pasting text from another application into the body pane.  Leo.py now writes body text containing unicode characters using Python's u-prefixed notation.  That is, the body text is written as: u'escaped_text'  where escaped text replaces unicode characters not in the ascii character set by escape sequences of the form \uxxxx.  The result contains nothing but ascii characters, so leo.py will have no problem reading it.  Naturally, compilers and other tools may not understand Python's notation, so you may have to convert escaped text to something that your tools can understand.

3.  This file, LeoDocs.leo, now more closely matches the documentation on Leo's web site.</t>

This version of Leo adds Import and Export commands and fixes several bugs:

1. All Import and Export commands now work. Several of these commands are found only in Leo.py.  Some of these commands may be of beta quality.

I use Import commands mainly for studying other people's code.  Be wary of generating source files from trees generated by the Import commands.

2. Fixed a bug that caused Leo to crash when a node was moved up in front of the previous root node.

3. Fixed several bugs in the syntax colorer.  One of these bugs caused Leo to crash when handling CWEB.

4. Leo now colors strings green.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.598">I use Import commands mainly for studying other people's code.  Be wary of generating source files from trees generated by the Import commands.

The Remove Sentinels command can "clean" files for publication or walk-throughs.  You can also use the Remove Sentinels command to prepare files for comparisons.  For example, one could study a file, say f.py, as follows:

1. Use the Import Files command to create an @file tree, say @file f2.py, for study.  Changing the name to f2.py ensures that saving the .leo file won't destroy the original file.

2. Use the Remove Sentinels command to create a file f3.py.  Use a file comparison program to ensure that f1.py is identical to f3.py.</t>

<t tx="edream.110203163054.600">Fixed a bug that caused Leo to hang when syntax coloring noweb code with the CWEB syntax colorer.

The syntax colorizer now handles Python triple strings and C preprocessor directives properly.

Leo now colors strings with the same green used by IDLE.  I think this color looks very good.

Improved the syntax coloring for CWEB.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.601">leo.py version 2.0                             March 4, 2002

leo.py v2.0 and Borland Leo v2.6 are being released simultaneously.  I urge all users of Leo to upgrade to one or both of these versions.  Note: the Untangle commands of both v2.0 and v2.6 should be considered beta quality.  Please report any problems with Untangle ASAP.

This is an important milestone in Leo's history, for several reasons:

1. For the first time, leo.py (v2.0) and the Borland Leo (v2.6) are functionally identical.  In particular, their respective Tangle commands produce identical output.

2. All "mission critical" aspects of leo.py are now complete: only the Import commands remain unfinished. leo.py v2.0 adds unlimited Undo/Redo, Untangle and full syntax coloring.  Unlimited Undo/Redo are reason enough to upgrade to v2.0.

3. leo.py v2.0 and Borland Leo v2.6 introduce an optimized format for derived files: both versions remove blank lines from between sentinel lines.  This is an upward compatible change in the format of derived files: leo.py v2.0 and Borland Leo v2.6 can read derived files from all previous versions of Leo, but previous versions of Leo can not read derived files without blanks lines between sentinels.

See the children of this node for full details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.602">leo.py v2.0 optionally can remove blanks from between sentinel lines in derived files.  This is an upward compatible change in the format of derived files: leo.py v2.0 can read derived files from all previous versions of Leo, but previous versions of Leo can not read derived files without blanks lines.

Removing blank lines requires a new kind of sentinel, the "verbatimAfterRef" sentinel.  This allows Leo to handle comments following section references that would otherwise be treated as sentinels themselves.  For example:
   
   &lt;&lt; section &gt;&gt; #+others
   
Leo removes blanks lines between sentinels by default.  To cause Leo not to remove blank lines do the following.  In the section called &lt;&lt; initialize atFile ivars &gt;&gt; in leoAtFile.py, change:

	self.suppress_newlines = true
to
	self.suppress_newlines = false

Note: leo.py v2.0 can read derived files without blank lines between sentinels regardless of the setting of self.suppress_newlines.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.603">leo.py supports unlimited Undo and Redo.  All outline operations and all typing operations may be undone and redone.  Undo state persists even after Saves.  Even the Change All command is undoable.  Only the "Read @file Nodes" command is undoable; it clears the entire undo state. This command raises a dialog to allow the user to cancel.

Think of the actions that may be Undone or Redone as a string of beads.  A "bead pointer" points to the present bead.  Performing an operation creates a new bead after the present bead and removes all following beads.  Undoing an operation moves the bead pointer backwards; redoing an operation moves the bead pointer forwards.  The Undo command is disabled when the bead pointer moves in front of the first bead; the Redo command is disabled when the bead pointer points to the last bead.

2. @unit, @root, @nocolor and @color now terminate doc parts.

2. Untangle did not recognize @ on a line by itself as the start of a doc part.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.611">@c now works the same as @code.  This makes the syntax colorers agree with what the Tangle commands actually do.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.614">leo.py version 1.0                             February 10, 2002

Version 1.0 adds many new features and fixes several bugs.  I recommend that all users of leo.py upgrade to this version.  This version deserves the number 1.0; it has no known bugs.

Here are the highlights of this release.  See the children of this node for details.

1. Fixed bugs: the Tangle All and Tangle Marked commands didn't work at all. Fixed several bugs in the Find and Change commands.  The "Suboutline Only" option now applies to the Search All and Change All commands.  Settings in the Preferences Panel now "stick" properly to the currently selected window.  Fixed many minor bugs.

2. leo.py now re-marks @file trees as dirty if errors are found while writing those trees.  This makes it difficult to write derived files that will be out-of-synch when read again.

3. New commands and features:  Added the Revert, Select All, Delete, Sort Children, Sort Siblings, Contract Parent (very useful!) and Toggle Active Pane commands, and all commands in the Edit Body menu, and all the Go To commands in the Move/Select menu. The Show Invisibles commands is ugly, and useful nonetheless.

The Edit Body commands work much more reliably than the similar commands in the Borland version of Leo.  You may now specify Python scripts rather than .bat files in the Preferences panel. Added a way, albeit clumsy, to cut and paste nodes between Borland Leo and leo.py.  When syntax coloring Python text, leo.py increments the auto-indentation by one tab after a trailing colon.  This provides a subtle reminder to add such colons.

4. leo.py handles events and shortcuts properly.  The shortcut for the Insert Node command is now Control-I, as it is in the Borland version of Leo.  Worked around a TK bug that prevented double-clicks from properly selecting words.  leo.py enables and disables all menu items properly.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.615">Removed the Print and Page setup commands because Tk provides no support for printing.  This is not significant: we can use the export commands to create text files.  These text files can then be formatted and printed as desired.

The following commands remain unfinished.  They will be finished in this order:

1. Untangle commands. 
	
2. Import/Export commands.

3. Unlimited Undo and Redo.

4. Toggle Split Direction, Cascade and Recent Windows commands.

5. Font Panel and Syntax Coloring commands.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.616">It should be possible to cut a node or tree in Borland Leo and paste it using the Copy Node command in leo.py.  At present, cutting and pasting trees between applications can only be done indirectly.  Do this:

1. Copy the tree in Borland Leo using the Copy Node or Cut Node command.
2. Paste the tree into empty body text of leo.py using the Paste command from the Edit menu, _not_ the Paste Node command from the Outline menu.
3. Select all the body text and choose Copy or Cut from the Edit menu.
4. Move to the tree view, and choose Paste Node.

I hope to make this unpleasantness go away soon.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.617">1. Fixed the Tangle All and Tangle Marked commands.  They always crashed.

2. The Change command did not work in headlines because of a reversion in how headline text is selected.

3. All event handlers now return "break".  This prevents further event handling and allows leo.py to handle events properly.  This cleared up the last major mystery in leo.py.

4. Settings in the Prefs Panel now "stick" to windows.  That is, they change when the user selects a new Leo window.  In particular, the Default Tangle Directory is restored properly.  This is important, as otherwise the Tangle commands might write files to the wrong place.

5. Removed calls to trace during shutdown.  In general, it is not possible to call app() during shutdown because the app object may no longer exist.

6. @others was not syntax colored properly if it was indented.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.618">1. Adding trailing whitespace to a line in body text does not set the file-dirty mark.  This can never cause a derived file to become "out-of-synch" because the read code does not compare body text.

Apparently there is no way to fix this bug because of holes in Tk's event mechanism.  Specifically, tree.idle_body_key has no way to tell directly what keystroke caused it to be entered.

2. Cutting and pasting between applications can only be done indirectly.  See the node called
"How to copy an outline from Borland Leo to Leo.py".</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.619">leo.py version 0.08                             February 3, 2002

Version 0.08 adds important new features and fixes several bugs.  All users of version 0.07 should upgrade to this version.  This code seems solid, and significant bugs may remain.  Note: this code has been tested only on Windows XP.  Please report any problems with Linux or Macintosh.

This is the first version of Leo to feel as smooth as the Borland v2.5. leo.py is now less buggy than v2.5; the Borland version will soon be upgraded to match leo.py.

Here is a summary of new features.  See the children of this node for full details.

1. The Find and Change commands are fully functional.  These commands support Tk's "advanced regular expressions" when the "pattern match" option is checked.  Tk's regular expressions are documented at:

  http://tcl.activestate.com/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/regexp.htm

2. The Tangle commands work; leo.py now supports @root trees.  The next release will support the Untangle commands.  Converting the Untangle code to Python is almost complete.

3. Leo now ensures that the currently selected headline is always visible, scrolling the outline pane as needed.

4. Improved Leo's memory management and eliminated several serious bugs.  One bug caused errors while reading @file trees.  Eliminating this is a huge step forward.  This bug exists in the Borland version of Leo and will be fixed soon.

5. Leo now underlines undefined section references.  Added support for hyperlinking, but disabled hyperlinking because it is not very useful without browser navigation buttons.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.620">leo.py handles Find and Change commands much more smoothly than does the Borland version of Leo.  Indeed, I plan to rewrite the Borland code to match the code in leo.py.

In general, leo.py handles the Find and Change commands more smoothly than does the Borland version of Leo.  Note: the node that "anchors" wrapped searches is the current node when any change is made to the Find panel.  The anchor is recomputed after a wrapped search fails.

Changed the meaning of a Find panel setting from "batch" to "context".  This will be changed in a future Borland version.  In the meantime, setting the "context" option in leo.py will set the "batch" option in the Borland version.

The "context" option affects only the "Find All" and "Change All" commands.  When this option is in effect, more context information is printed when matches are found.

The "reverse" option affects all Searches and Changes, both those initiated from the Find Panel itself, and those initiated from menu commands.  In particular, F3 will find the previous search if the "reverse" option is in effect.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.621">The Tangle command has passed significant tests, and bugs may remain.  Be warned.

leo.py's Tangle command produces output that is slightly different from Leo v2.5. The differences are insignificant; here is the complete list:

1. The header line, i.e., the first comment line of the tangled file: leo.py produces forward slashes in the path name, Leo v2.5 produces back slashes.

2. Leading whitespace: leo.py produces "optimized" leading whitespace.  leo.py removes blanks if they do not affect the visual appearance of whitespace; this depends on the tab width specified in the Preferences Panel.  Leo v2.5 copies leading whitespace exactly.  The leo.py way is preferable; it will produce output acceptable to Python's tabnanny regardless of tab width used while running Python.

3. Trailing blanks lines in body text: leo.py removes all trailing whitespace.  Leo v2.5 does not.  Conceivably, leo.py might have to change to make the Untangle command work properly.  More likely the leo.py way is just better.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.622">Underlining "live" links clutters the screen too much, and hyperlinks from section references to section definitions isn't very useful without the standard "back" and "forward" buttons typically found in web browsers.  For these reasons, I have disabled hyperlinking.

To enable hyperlinking, just set:

	self.use_hyperlinks = true
	
in color.__init__ in the @file leoColor.py tree.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.623">1. Fixed several bugs involving cloned headlines.  One bug caused cloned headlines not to be updated in synch.  Another bug caused @file trees not to be marked as dirty under certain conditions.

Both bugs could have caused read errors while reading @file trees, so fixing these bugs is a big step forward.  I have experienced no read errors since fixing these bugs.  A huge step forward.  This bug exists in the Borland versions of Leo and should be fixed ASAP.

2. There was a big performance bug lurking in the tree code that became apparent during testing of the Find and Change commands.  Closing a window could take almost a minute if the tree had been redrawn many times.  Old widgets were never deleted until the window was closed.  This may be a problem with tkinter, and the workaround was straightforward.

3. Fixed a bug in the "Save To" command.  After doing a Save To, a following Save command used the Save To file name!  This explains why some saves "didn't take".

4. Fixed a bug in the Save commands.  Cancelling a Save dialog did not work: instead it wrote a file called ".leo".  I am not sure whether this bug occurred in previous releases. 

5. All Save commands now always recompute file indices.  This old logic accomplished very little, and introduced needless differences between the various kinds of Save commands.

6. Made file and path name processing more portable.  Removed all calls to os.chdir().

7. Fixed a bug that caused a control-d to delete a character in the body pane when the Move Down command didn't do anything, i.e., when the presently selected node was the bottom node on the screen.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.624">1. Used Tk.Text widgets in headlines rather than Tk.Entry widgets.  This allows the Find/Change commands to search headlines.  Control-k no longer deletes text following the cursor in headlines.

2. Improved the performance of screen updates and markedly reduced flicker in the body pane.

3. Found a way to handle keystrokes without knowing the status of the control and alt keys.  The idle event handlers now ignore the actual keystrokes in most cases, and take action solely based on whether the headline or body text has actually changed as the result of those keystrokes.  If not, we can assume that a command has been entered and we do not set the dirty or changed bits.

4. Replaced es_newline global with app().log.es_newline, i.e., frame.es_newline.  This is better than before because each log stream now has its own newline count.

5. Reduced width of the log pane to give more space to the tree pane.

6. The LeoPy folder now contains a dummy file called __init__.py.  This file marks the LeoPy folder as a potential package.

7. Added several new functions to the file leo.py.  These are useful for invoking leo.py from a Python interpreter.  See the section "How to Install &amp; Run Leo" for details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.625">Previous version of leo.py did not release memory when windows close.  This version does.

Memory management is remarkably easy in Python/Tk.  Added __del__ routines and corresponding destroy routines to the frame, vnode and tree classes.  The destroy routines eliminate circular references between objects. The __del__ routines do nothing except print debugging traces; we know that all references to an object have been removed when its __del__ routine is called.

Added app.deleteOnClose ivar to control memory management.  When true, Leo deletes all frame objects when a frame closes.  This is always true at present.

Fixed a memory botch: previously a dummy vnode was allocated for every vnode created while reading files.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.626">Starting with this release, you will see trace statements throughout the code.  The trace function is defined in leoUtils.py; trace implements much of the functionality of my Sherlock tracing package.  Traces are more convenient than print statements for two reasons: 1) you don't need explicit trace names and 2) you can disable them without recompiling.

In the following examples, suppose that the call to trace appears in function f.

trace(string) prints string if tracing for f has been enabled.  For example, the following statement prints from s[i] to the end of the line if tracing for f has been enabled.

	j = skip_line(s,i) ; trace(s[i:j])

trace(function) executes the function if tracing for f has been enabled.  For example,

	trace(self.f2)

You enable and disable tracing by calling init_trace(args).  Examples:

	init_trace("+*")         # enable all traces
	init_trace("+a","+b")    # enable traces for a and b
	init_trace(("+a","+b"))  # enable traces for a and b
	init_trace("-a")         # disable tracing for a
	traces = init_trace("?") # return the list of enabled traces

If two arguments are supplied to trace, the first argument is the "tracepoint name" and the second argument is the "tracepoint action" as shown in the examples above.  If tracing for the tracepoint name is enabled, the tracepoint action is printed (if it is a string) or executed (if it is a function name).

"*" will not match an explicit tracepoint name that starts with a minus sign.  For example,

	trace("-nocolor", self.disable_color)</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.627">Rewrote the code that computes file names.  This should have two beneficial effects:

Note:  This code has only been tested on Windows XP.

1. The code should be more portable.  I've used os.path.join throughout to concatenate parts of filenames, and this should handle differences involving path separators on different platforms.

2. The code no longer calls os.chdir().  The "current application directory" changes only as the result of completing file open and save dialogs.  In particular, @path, @root and @file do not change the current application directory.

3. Used leo.__file__ to get the directory from which leo.py was loaded.  This seems to be reliable, though it has only been tested on Windows XP.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.628">The following features of leo.py will be incorporated into the Borland version 2.6 of Leo:

1. Improve leading whitespace handling in Tangle.

2. Fix clone bugs (rewrite vnode::setDirty).  These bugs can cause errors while reading @file nodes.

3. Improve Find/Change commands. Change "batch" to "context".  This will make the Preferences Panel work identically in both programs.

4. Always recompute file indices and compute file indices.  This will make derived files produced by v2.6 identical to the files produced by leo.py.

5. Make sure all file names end in .leo.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.629">I urge anyone using leo.py upgrade to this version.  This is the first version of leo.py that has been thoroughly tested.

See the children of this node details about this release.  Here are the highlights:

1. Fixed many bugs, including a bug that can cause body text to be lost when creating a new headline.

2. The Python window now works. You can now run Python scripts from within leo.py!

3. Added a script to convert Leo files from Leo 1 to Leo 2 format.

4. @nocolor and @color are now inherited properly from ancestor nodes.

5. Added Leo Documentation to Help menu.  This command opens LeoDocs.leo.
	
6. Added auto indent to body pane.

For even more details, see the diary entries for January 6-9 in LeoPy.leo.

See the To Do lists in LeoPy.leo for a list of unfinished features.  The primary unfinished features are the Find/Change commands, preferences settings and the Tangle/Untangle commands.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.630">This is the first version of leo.py that has been heavily tested.  About 70 percent of my work on leo.py has been done using leo.py itself.   I know of no remaining bugs that can cause data to be lost.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.631">I have concentrated on removing all significant irritations encountered while using leo.py.  Far fewer still remain than before.  Among the remaining irritations:

1. Syntax coloring happens at "idle time", that is, after all events have been handled.  This means that characters are initially colored black, then changed to another couple after an obvious delay.  The obvious event-handling code does not work.  Perhaps using a "virtual event" may work.

2. Keystrokes that should initiate commands _also_ get passed to widgets.  I am hoping to find a way around this, and it may take a bit of work.  The two biggest offender:  Control-k while editing a headline deletes from the cursor to the end of the headline (in addition to creating a new node!)  Control-i gets passed to the body pane as a tab.

3. The border around the tree pane gets over-written by headlines.  I'm not sure how to fix this: it is certainly a Tk bug.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.632">Fixed a bug that can cause body text to be lost when creating a new node.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.633">Choosing Open Python Window brings up IDLE, the standard Python IDE, from which scripts may be run and debugged.

Note: The path to idle.py must exist in sys.paths.  For Python2.1 on windows, this path will typically be \Python21\Tools\idle  If this path does not exist, a message will be sent to the log pane.  The usual way to add a path to sys.paths is to modify the sitecustomize.py file.

Changed names of several vnode and commands methods to make them compatible with the scripting documentation on Leo's web site.   You may now run any script that runs on Borland Leo on leo.py.

When running scripts from leo.py, you may refer to any method or instance variable (attribute) in the code for leo.py.  If you want to run those scripts on Borland Leo you should restrict yourself to the methods documented in the Scripting chapter of Leo's online documentation.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.634">To convert an @root tree to an @file tree, choose the root of the tree to be converted, then do the following in the Python window:

	import c2py
	c2py.leo1to2()
	
This script makes numerous changes throughout the tree.  It does not, however, change @root to @file, or insert the needed @others directives.  You must do that by hand.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.635">At long last it is possible to open this file, LeoDocs.leo, from the help menu.

This command will work only if LeoDocs.leo is located in the directory in which leo.py exists.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.636">The body pane now has auto-indent on at all times.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.637">leo.py version 0.06 (alpha)                     December 20, 2001

This version fixes several minor problems that prevented leo.py from running on Linux.  There is no need to upgrade to this version if leo.py works on your system.  This version is neither more nor less stable than version 0.05.  This file, LeoDocs.leo, has also been improved substantially.

There still may be problems running leo.py on Linux.  You may be able to fix those problems yourself after reading this file... I'll be on vacation until about January 8.  I may be able to answer questions on Leo's SourceForge site, and I'll make no code changes until then.

Problems fixed:

1.  Removed call to print_stack() in es() logic.  If there are problems during initialization this logic printed "Null log" and then printed a stack dump.  This dump was more confusing than helpful.

2.  Changed "darkblue" to "DarkBlue".  The standard colors known to Tk are listed at
	http://tcl.activestate.com/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm
	
If you have more problems with unknown colors, please use a color listed above.

3.  Eliminated some accelerators (Linux only).  You may take an exception in createAccelerators() in leoFrame.py if Linux does not support the accelerators defined in one of the following sections:

  &lt;&lt; control key bindings &gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt; alt key bindings &gt;&gt;
  
Just comment out the relevant entry.  Please let me know which accelerators don't work.  I can add platform-specific code to deal with them.

4.  Added loaddir code to leo.py.  Leo tries to guess where leo.py was loaded from.  If this doesn't work leo may take an exception in leo.py.

As a temporary hack, please set loaddir correctly in the following code at the start of leo.py:

  # loaddir should be the directory that contains leo.py
  if sys.platform=="win32":
    loaddir = "c:\\prog\\LeoPy\\"
  else:
    loaddir = "LeoPy"
	
5. Removed bullet 0x95 characters from this file. They don't show up well on Linux.

6. In leoTree.py, changed the filenames from x.gif to x.GIF.  Linux is more picky about case in filenames than Windows.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.638">leo.py version 0.05 (alpha)                      December 17, 2001

This version of Leo marks a major milestone in Leo's history.  leo.py is the first functional version of Leo written completely in Python and Tkinter, Python's interface to the tcl/Tk system.

leo.py is quite useable. leo.py should work on any machine with recent Python and tcl/Tk interpreters.  This version of Leo was created using Windows XP, Python 2.1 and tcl/Tk 8.3.

Warning: This version is alpha quality.  Use extreme caution: please save your work often and make full backups of all .leo files and derived files.

Please read this node's children before sending bug reports or feature requests.  Send all bug reports to Leo's SourceForge web site at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/

<t tx="edream.110203163054.639">I have been happily using leo.py to develop itself for the last three days without serious problems.  leo.py reads and writes all its source files exactly as does the Borland version.  This is an important test, and significant errors may remain.

Performance on a 1.2 Ghz Pentium is good to excellent.  Drawing the screen happens quickly, smoothly and without flicker.  Expanding and contracting nodes is usually excellent, and slows when a many nodes have been expanded.  Syntax coloring appears instantaneous, even with an unsophisticated algorithm.  Loading LeoPy.leo files takes about 3 seconds. This could be improved by using Python's XML classes.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.640">You must have recent versions of Python and tcl/Tk installed on your machine.
Download Python from http://python.org/
Download tcl/Tk from http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/

After installing Python and Tk, run Leo double clicking the file leo.py in the LeoPy folder.  On Windows this will bring up a Leo window and a black Python interpreter window.

The LeoPy folder contains all files in this distribution.  leo.py is the main source file; run Leo by double clicking leo.py.  The Python interpreter will create corresponding .pyc files as .py files are imported by leo.py.

LeoPy.leo is the master source code file; all .py files were derived from LeoPy.leo.  c2py.py and leoCompare.py are tools that should be run from a Python interpreter.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.643">Unfinished Commands and Features:

	Revert.
	All Tangle and Untangle commands.
	All Import commands.
	All Find and Change commands.
	Sort Children command.
	Toggle Split Direction, Toggle Active Pane and Cascade commands.
	Auto indent in the body pane.
	The Preferences panel is semi-functional: see note one below.
	The Find panel is non-functional.
	The Python scripting window is non-functional.
	Syntax Coloring Options and Font Options windows are not ready yet.
	@color and @nocolor directives are not inherited yet.

Notes:

1. The Preferences panel is partly functional.  The default target language option has no effect: syntax coloring is for Python only.  Tab width can not be changed; tabs are 8 characters wide.

2. Menu items are not yet dynamically dimmed and undimmed.  Some non-functional commands have undimmed menus.  Keyboard accelerators work even for dimmed menus.

3. Scripting Leo is not possible yet.  You can't control Leo from the Python interpreter because control passes to the Tk event loop.

4. Leo's Save commands do not yet save the information about which node was visible at the top of the tree.

5. The Save/SaveAs/SaveTo dialogs don't handle shortcuts to folders properly; they try to replace the shortcut with the .leo file.

6. Initialization code in leo.py computes the directory from which Leo was loaded using argv[0].  I am not sure this is proper, though I have had no problems recently.  Tree icons will not load properly if argv[0] does not specify this directory.  If the path is invalid Leo will print: os.chdir failed: `dir`

7. The tree class does not automatically ensure that the current node is visible after an outline operation.

8. The font used in the body pane is not great.  I hope to improve it.

9. Headline text is sometimes obscured.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.644">leo.py already feels less buggy than the wxWindows versions of Leo.  Rewriting Leo in Python and Tkinter has greatly improved the code. Further improvements are possible.  BTW, work began in earnest on this version of Leo in late October, 2001.  It's been a great month.

The following problems have resisted my initial attempts at solving them.  Any help from Tk experts would be appreciated:

1. Window icons are the Tk icon, not the nifty Leo icon.  Really, there _must_ be a way to do this!

2. Can variable-width tabs can be done in Tk?  If not, Leo may have to convert tabs to blanks as specified by the preferences panel.

3. Cut, copy and paste work in the log and body panes using Control-X, Control-C and Control-V keys.  However, there are no Cut, Copy or Paste menu items in the Edit menu.  Is it possible to send simulated keystrokes to a text widget?

4. Some menu accelerators do not seem to be available in Tk.  In particular, many of the items in the submenus of the Outline menu have no accelerators yet.  These commands are useful only if they can be chosen from the keyboard rather than the menu.

5. The border of the tree control is gray.  It can be overwritten by large headlines.  This appears to be a Tk or Tkinter bug; I haven't found any way to eliminate the border or color it white.

6. There doesn't seem to be a way to select all the headline text when editing starts.  The click that starts editing always clears the selection.

7. Changing the type of leo.py to .pyw doesn't seem to work.

8. A message flash briefly on the screen when leo.py exits, too fast to read. These messages do not appear when invoking leo.py from the Python interpreter.  They probably would be visible in a Linux window.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.645">It will be much easier to make such improvements to leo.py than to previous versions of Leo. Here is my list of new things to do:

1. Create "hyperlinks" from section references to section definitions.  This will happen in the next release.

2. Add automatic "tab nanny" checking and full syntax checking of Python body text.

3. Build a file/directory comparison window using code in leoCompare.py.

4. Build a Python debugger into Leo.  Python provides excellent hooks for debugging and tracing.  Python's stand-alone IDLE debugger doesn't seem to work well with the Tk command loop.

5. Expand Leo's file format to take advantage of the power of Tk text widgets.

This version fixes a bug that can cause errors while reading derived files.  Earlier versions do not ensure that clone indices in derived files are distinct.

I recommend that all users of the Windows version of Leo upgrade to this version.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.648">Leo Borland version 2.6                             March 4, 2002

leo.py v2.0 and Borland Leo v2.6 are being released simultaneously.  I urge all users of Leo to upgrade to one or both of these versions.  This is an important milestone in Leo's history,  For the first time, leo.py (v2.0) and the Borland Leo (v2.6) are functionally identical.  In particular, their respective Tangle commands produce identical output.

Borland version 2.6 fixes major problems and contains numerous changes to make it fully compatible with leo.py v2.0.  Highlights of Borland v2.6:

1. Fixes bugs that caused spurious errors while reading @file trees.  Such errors can destroy clone links.

2. Supports an improved format for derived files.  This format is used by leo.py 2.0.  This is an upward compatible change: previous versions of Leo can not read the new format, and this version of Leo can read all previous derived files.

3. Fixes two long-standing bugs in the Untangle command.

4. As mentioned above, the Tangle commands are byte-for-byte compatible with leo.py v2.0.  Also, @c is now equivalent to @code.

5. Adds two very useful commands: Sort Siblings and Contract Parent.

See the Children of this node for full details.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.649">This version of Leo removes blanks from between sentinel lines in derived files.  This version of Leo is fully compatible with leo.py v2.0 in this regard.

This is an upward compatible change in the format of derived files: Borland Leo v2.6 can read derived files from all previous versions of Leo, but previous versions of Leo can not read derived files without blanks lines.

Removing blank lines requires a new kind of sentinel, the "verbatimAfterRef" sentinel.  This allows Leo to handle comments following section references that would otherwise be treated as sentinels themselves.  For example:
   
   &lt;&lt; section &gt;&gt; #+others</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.650">Whenever a node changes, Leo now ensures that all nodes cloned to it, and all ancestor @file nodes are marked dirty.  This is the cause of spurious read errors.

As a side effect, nodes now become dirty when they move.

This change was made in leo.py v0.8.

It is also vital that @file nodes remain dirty until they are written without errors.  Otherwise, a Save command will succeed without warning, and a later read may cause the dreaded "clones have been cleared" message.

This change was made in leo.py v1.0.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.651">@c now works the same as @code.  This makes the syntax colorers agree with what the Tangle commands actually do.  Previously, the syntax colorers indicated that everything following an @c was code, while the Tangle commands placed everything following an @c in the doc part!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.652">This version fixes two long-standing bugs:

1. Untangle did not work properly for languages like Perl and Python that do not have block comments. 

2. Untangle did not recognize @ on a line by itself as the start of a doc part.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.653">The Tangle commands are now byte-for-byte compatible with leo.py 2.0.  Tangle outputs "optimized" leading whitespace just as leo.py does.  This can be important in Python programs.

All the Save commands now recompute clone indices just as in leo.py 2.0.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.654">The "Show Context" checkbox in the Find Panel is presently non-functional.  (In leo.py it affects the messages produced by the Find All and Change All commands.)</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.655">Unlike leo.py, the Borland version of Leo can not ensure that saved outlines have .leo extensions.

There are two problems:

1.  The ensureExtension routine is called after the dialog closes.  If this routine changes the file name we could overwrite an existing file!

2.  There appears to be problems with the Borland DefaultExt field.  Setting this field causes crashes.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.656">This version fixes several serious bugs.  All users of Leo2 should upgrade to version 2.5 immediately.

1. Eliminated the ill-fated automatic updating feature.  This turns out to be very dangerous and disconcerting.  If one makes changes to the .leo file and does not save those changes, a later update could erase those unsaved changes!

2. Removing automatic updating also fixed another bug:  The current outline node was not being selected properly when a .leo file was read, so that in some cases the body text did not correspond to the selected outline node.  This never caused loss of data, and was disconcerting.

3. Fixed a bug that caused Find/Change settings to be saved to a file only if a find or change command was actually executed.

4. Restored several parts of Leo2(cb).leo that were inadvertently erased due to earlier bugs.  In particular, the outlines for xbuf.c and xbuf.h have now been restored.

One bug remains.  On Windows XP, the cursor is obscured in the Find/Change dialog when it is at the far left of the Find or Change text areas.  This may be a botch in the XP text control itself.  The solution would be to create a border in the text areas, and there is no obvious way to do this using the Borland classes.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.657">Version 2.4 is a major improvement in Leo2.  I urge all users of Leo2 to upgrade to this version.  See the children of this node for full details.

The "old" Leo2 tried to save space by not writing all information in @file trees.  This was a serious mistake.  The "new" Leo2 saves all information in an outline to the .leo file, including all information in @file trees.
Once again you may back up a project merely by backing up the project's .leo file.  There is no Archive command, and no need for one.  All .leo files are now safe archives.

As the result of the change in file formats, Leo 2.4 may clear clone links when loading derived files created with previous versions of Leo.  Leo 2.4 will issue detailed messages when that happens.

The new Leo2 is much safer and more convenient to use than the old Leo2.  Error messages and error recovery have been improved.

Leo2 updates @file trees automatically when Leo2 is activated.  For example, suppose you change a derived file in another editor, say in an IDE.  Leo2 will update the @file tree when you switch to Leo, provided that you have saved the file in the IDE.  Warning: due to several apparent bugs in the Delphi code, this feature only works if the main Leo window is at least partially visible on the screen (!)
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.658">Version 2.4 fixes several bugs involving clones.

1. Version 2.4 rewrites clone indices when writing derived filed, so node sentinels accurately reflect the clone status of the node.  The node sentinel for the root node no longer contains the maximum clone index.  Leo2 clears the root's clone index on reading and writing so that the root node is not mistakenly joined so another node!

2. Version 2.4 takes more care to recreate clone links properly when reading derived files.  A derived file can be read into a .leo file different from the .leo that wrote the derived file, so Leo2 makes sure that clone links are proper in the .leo file being opened.  A minor drawback: .leo files now are "big", so reading them is a little slower.

Note: Clone links into @file trees work only if the .leo file is "in synch" with the files derived from the @file trees.  Clone links will break if the .leo file and derived files are not in synch.  Typically "backup" .leo files will be out-of-synch with present derived files, so it's best to use "backup" .leo files only in emergencies, for example to revert a project to a previous state.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.659">The "old" Leo2 tried to save space by not writing all information in @file trees.  This was a serious mistake.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.660">The archive command was a backup disaster waiting to happen.  It has been replaced by the following four file commands are located in the File:Read/Write submenu.

Read Outline Only: reads an outline using only the .leo file, not any files derived from @file nodes.  This command is useful for reverting a project to a previously saved state.

Read @file Nodes: updates all @file nodes in an outline.  This ensures that the state of an outline matches all files derived from @file nodes.  Included for completeness.  This happens automatically when a .leo file is first read, and it also happens automatically when Leo2 is reactivated.

Write Outline Only: saves an outline without writing any @file trees.  Useful for inserting an @file node into an outline without modifying a derived file with the same name.

Write @file Nodes: forces an update of all @file trees.  Surprisingly useful.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.661">Leo2 updates @file trees automatically when Leo2 is activated.  For example, suppose you change a derived file in another editor, say in an IDE.  Leo2 will update the @file tree when you switch to Leo, provided that you have saved the file in the IDE.

<t tx="edream.110203163054.662">Revised for version 2.4

Loading and saving .leo files usually keeps the .leo file and derived files "in synch".  However, if you create backup .leo files, it can easily happen that the structure of @file nodes in the backup .leo files no longer matches that structure in the derive files.  Leo2 will detect this condition the next time you next open the old .leo file.  When that happens, Leo2 discards the entire out-of-synch @file tree, and recreates it solely using the derived file.  In the process all marks and clone links from outside the file are lost. Leo2 issues the messages:

	Error reading @file &lt;filename&gt;
	-- Rereading file.  Clone links into this file will be lost.

to remind you that the .leo file you are using is out-of-date.  Saving the .leo file will bring it up to date.

If one or more sentinel lines in a derived file have been corrupted in some way, by inserting, deleting, altering or moving a sentinel, Leo issues these messages:

	Error reading @file &lt;filename&gt;
	&lt;An error message about a bad sentinel&gt;
	-- Rereading file.  Clone links into this file will be lost.
	&lt;An error message about a bad sentinel&gt; (again)
	----- File may have damaged sentinels!

Data may not actually be lost, and the outline structure will be seriously damaged.  The most sensible thing to do is to restore the derived file from a .leo file using the Read Outline Only command.

No error recovery is attempted when automatically updating @file trees.  If an error is found the update is canceled (leaving the outline unchanged) and the following message is given:

    -- Update canceled due to structure errors
	
We don't attempt error recovery because error recovery would clear clone links.  For example, suppose we are editing a .leo file, and for some reason we also edit a derived file _without_ saving the .leo file.  Now the files could be out of synch!  So it is best not to press on with an automatic update.
	</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.663">Revised for version 2.4

If Leo2 detects orphan or ignored nodes while writing an @file node it saves all information in the @file tree in the outline (.leo) file.  No information is lost.  When the .leo file is read again Leo2 will load the information in the @file tree from the .leo file, not the derived file.

As a reminder, Leo2 marks the erroneous @file node as dirty so that saving the .leo file will attempt to rewrite the @file node.  Version 2.4 no longer marks the @file node as "stuck on dirty".  If you save the .leo file the dirty mark will be cleared.  However, the @file node will be dirty every time the file is read until all errors are corrected.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.664">@file trees are less flexible than @root trees:

1.  You can not use section definitions in more than one file.  For example, you can't define declarations in one file to be used in another file.  If you need all the features of noweb you must use @root trees.

2. @file trees use no escape conventions whatever.  A code part in an @file tree contains a section reference if &lt;&lt; precedes &gt;&gt; on the line, regardless of whether &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; are contained in strings or comments.  In practice, such "false references" occur infrequently, and the workaround is simply to split the offending line.  Moreover, noweb's escape conventions (@&lt;&lt; and @&gt;&gt;) cause problems in @root trees, so this "drawback" is very minor.

3. Clone links into @file trees work only if the .leo file is "in synch" with the files derived from the @file trees.  In particular, backup .leo files will usually be out of synch with derived files.  Clone links will break otherwise.  To recover from such errors, simply use the "Read Outline Only" command.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.665">Note: 10/19/01: I recommend that all users upgrade to version 2.4.  There are some serious problems with version 2.3.

This version of Leo contains some significant improvements.  See the children of this node for details:

1. The new @first directive allows you to place lines at the very start of files derived from @file nodes. For example, @first #!/usr/bin/env python

2. The log window is now part of the Leo window.  Very handy.

3. Fixed several bugs involving the Find command.

4. A new Archive command saves an entire outline (including all @file trees) to a .leo file.  Use this command with caution.  Loading and then saving a .leo file created with the Archive command will revert an entire project to the state it had when the archived .leo file was created.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.666">The @first directive allows you to place lines at the very start of files derived from @file nodes. For example, the body text of @file spam.py might be:

@first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of @file foo.perl might be:

@first #/usr/bin/perl

@first directives are recognized only at the start of the body text of @file nodes.  No text may precede @first directives.  More than one @first directive may exist, like this:

@first #! /usr/bin/env python
@first # more comments.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.667">The Archive command writes all nodes of an outline to a .leo file, including all parts of @file trees.  All @file trees are marked in such a way that when the archived .leo file is read 1) all @file trees will be restored from the archived outline rather from derived files and 2) all @file trees will be marked dirty so that when the archived .leo file is written all @file nodes will be updated.

Use the Archive command (and the files written by it) with caution: loading and then saving an archived .leo file will back up an entire project to its state when the archive was originally written!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.668">Added support for @c in syntax colorers for Python, Pascal, Perl, Java and HTML.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.669">Fixed a bug in the Change, Then Find command.  The Change, Then Find command would rescan the newly changed text if the "change text" contained the "find text" preceded by other text of length greater or equal to the length of the original "find text".

For example, changing "blah" to "const blah" would result in rescanning the newly inserted "blah".  This would cause the "Change All" command to hang.

The old code advanced the search point by the length of the "find text."  The new code advances the insertion point by the length of the "change text".

Fixed the Find/Change panel: some captions were cut off.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.670">@file nodes are now marked dirty whenever any change is made in the @file tree, including changes made as the result of changing cloned nodes outside the @file tree.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.671">Made the log window part of the Leo window.  Having the log be part of the leo window is very convenient.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.672">Leo2 readme file
Borland version 2.2, 9/16/01

This version fixes several bugs in Leo2:

1. Fixed a bug that causes all data in an @file tree to be lost under the following conditions:

A. The @file tree was erroneous, i.e., it contained orphan or ignored nodes.
B. The .leo file containing the erroneous tree was saved twice.

Leo2 now marks an erroneous @file node as "stuck on dirty" until the tree is fixed.  Recall that dirty nodes have icons with a black border rather than a gray border.  Whenever a file Save operation occurs, Leo2 will attempt to write all dirty @file trees, thereby reminding you that errors remain.  However, the .leo file itself is not "stuck on unsaved", so you won't be prompted to save the .leo file endlessly.

While fixing this bug I also improved error and warning messages relating to reading and writing @file nodes.  This should make it clear that a) data in erroneous @file trees is saved to the .leo file and b) data is recovered from the .leo file when reading erroneous @file nodes.

2. Fixed a bug relating to clones that could cause loss of data.  Leo2 now marks all clones dirty when any clone changes, and makes sure to mark @file nodes dirty that contain changed clones.

3.  Changed the code that writes @file trees to end lines with "\r\n" rather than "\n".  I hope this will improve matters, though I have my doubts.  Please report any problems with the new scheme immediately.

4. Added Write @file Nodes command.  The command writes all @file nodes in the selected tree, regardless of whether they have been changed.

5. Made the commands in the Main Leo2 window functional.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.673">Version 2.1 is the first public release of Leo2.  This version appears stable, and should be used with caution.

The major feature of Leo2 is that tangling and untangling happen automatically for all code derived from @file nodes.  

Remember to back up all files derived from @file nodes; such files are original source files!  It is no longer possible to back up an entire project by backing up a single .leo file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.674"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.675">Version 1.15 can read @file trees.  Leo warns when reading @file files, and changing @file trees in Leo v1.15 is not recommended.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.676">This version corrects a problem with double-clicking Leo icons under Windows Me.  You may now launch Leo by double-click the icon for any .leo file and you may open any .leo file by double-clicking on it.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.677">This version of Leo corrects a problem with how whitespace was handled in @silent mode.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.678">Barring serious bugs, version 1.12 is likely to be the last Borland/Windows version of Leo for a while.  The wxWindows versions of Leo are usable enough to justify putting all further work into them.

There are several important improvements in version 1.12:

1. Added the Sort command to the Outline menu.  This command sorts all the children of a node into alphabetical order.

2. A major improvement to Tangle.  In @silent mode, Tangle now outputs derived files with "verbatim" whitespace, that is, without any extra blanks, tabs and newlines.  This makes Tangle much more useful for Python, and in other applications.  For example, it is now possible to do the following in Python:

if &lt;&lt;condition1&gt;&gt; &amp;&amp; &lt;&lt;condition2&gt;&gt;:
	print &lt;&lt;list of vars&gt;&gt;

In the derived file, expansions of the sections will be placed on the lines in which the reference appears.  This works in Python as long as the expansions themselves appear on a single logical line.

This "verbatim" expansion only happens in @silent mode, so these kinds of derived files can not be Untangled.

3. Tangle now reports errors more fully and less redundantly.  Errors involving missing or erroneous path names (specified in @root directives, @path directives or the Preferences Panel) are more specific.  These errors are reported only once per Tangle command, and these errors terminate the Tangle command immediately.  This is wise; we don't want to write files to the wrong directory!  Finally, Tangle no longer prints the actual text of a section when giving the "possibly duplicate section definition" error.  This should be helpful: no longer are huge error messages generated.  It should be easy enough to find the relevant section definitions using Leo's find command.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.679">This version corrects a problem that can cause the Import CWEB Files command to hang in an endless loop.

This file also contains improved documentation (see the children of this node) in two sections:

1.  Added an explanation of the following error message given by the Tangle command: "Multiple parts not allowed for &lt;&lt; section name &gt;&gt;"

2.  Added a warning about using Untangle to update cloned nodes.
(See the last paragraph of the node.)</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.680">Sections can be defined in several parts in two ways:

1.  Using &lt;&lt; section name &gt;&gt;= in several places with the same section name.

2.  Using several @code directives within the _same_ body text.

As a precaution against mistakenly defining a section in more than one place, it is invalid to use @code in different nodes to define multiple parts for the same section.  In particular, this error may arise when using cloned nodes.

This error may always be eliminated by using &lt;&lt; section name &gt;&gt;= instead of @code.
	
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.681">The Untangle, Untangle All and Untangle Marked commands are the reverse of the corresponding Tangle commands.  They update an outline based on changes made to one or more derived files.  These are exceptionally useful commands.

For example, suppose you create a new part of the outline and Tangle it for the first time.  When you compile the resulting derived files for the first time, you are likely to get many syntax errors.  You could fix those errors in the outline and Tangle the outline again, but there is a much easier way:  you fix the errors in the derived files using the compiler's editor, then run the untangle command on the part of the outline that created the derived file.  The Untangle command updates the selected outline to match the changes in the derived files.  It's as simple as that.  By the way, the Untangle command marks all the nodes in the outline that it updates, and you can examine all such nodes with the Go To Next Marked command in the Outline menu.

You cannot use Untangle to update doc parts, or leading comments in code parts or "trivial" whitespace in code parts.  This is a limitation of the Untangle command that cannot be fixed; Untangle has no way of knowing whether leading comments came from doc parts or are just leading comments.

Untangle never changes the structure of an outline;  it never inserts, deletes or moves nodes.  Don't attempt to change the structure of an outline by modifying derived files; it won't work.  Also, never delete, move or alter the sentinel lines in derived files written by the Tangle command.  Such lines start with /// followed by a section name.

If you change the section name in a sentinel line Untangle will not update the code in the outline (with the old name) that generated the renamed section.  Untangle now warns about sections that appear in a derived file but not in the outline.  Untangle has no trouble with changed section references in derived files; it is only changed sentinel lines that cause problems.

Cloned nodes that generate code in several files may cause problems for Untangle if not all the code is changed the same way in derived files.  If Untangle is run separately on these derived files, Untangle will update all cloned nodes each time it is run, so only the code in the last Untangle run will take effect.  Therefore, the only reliable way to update text in cloned nodes is to make the change in the .leo file rather than the derived files.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.682">Version 1.10 incorporates the following changes:

1. The Untangle command no longer updates @doc chunks under any circumstances.  This makes Untangle safe to use when the "Tangle outputs doc chunks" preferences is not selected.  In previous versions the Untangle command would delete all @doc chunks in the outline when a derived file had been Tangled without "Tangle outputs doc chunks".

The new version of Untangle is experimental; only one line of code has been added.  I welcome any comments about this change.  This change also fixes (or rather bypasses) a crasher reported in Untangle.

2. The shortcut for the Execute Script command has been changed from Alt-E to Shift-Alt-E to avoid conflicting with the shortcut that brings up the edit menu.

</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.683">Version 1.9 contains several improvements that make Leo more Python-friendly:

1. The Execute Script command (Alt-E) in the Edit menu allows you to execute Python scripts directly from body text.

2. Several small changes make the Python window significantly easier to use.

Also, considerable reference (study-only) code has been removed from leo(CB).leo.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.684">It is now possible to execute any Python script directly from any body text.  Just select the script in the body text (including a trailing newline) and use the Execute Script (Alt-E) command from the edit menu.  The script is copied to the Python window and executed as usual.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.685">Several small changes make the Python window significantly easier to use:

1. The paste command now works in the Python window whenever the Python window is visible.  This fixes a bug that required a mouse click in either pane before paste would work.

2. It is now possible to execute scripts multi-line scripts pasted into the input pane.  Other changes make it easier (or possible) to terminate continued code.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.686">Fixed a crasher that makes it impossible to tangle outlines containing doc parts in languages like HTML that have no single-line comment delimiter.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.687">Leo v 1.7 accepts a slightly more general file format so that it can read XML generated from external XML tools.  Leo v 1.7 can read all previous .leo files.  Leo's Save commands remain unchanged.

Leo still only understands Leo files.  However, Leo now understands a slightly generalized form of Leo files. Specifically:

1.  Attributes may now appear in any order.  (Leo writes attributes in a fixed order, but some XSLT tools rewrite Leo files with attributes in a different order.)

2.  Leo will now accept &lt;tag/&gt; instead of &lt;tag&gt;stuff&lt;/tag&gt; when "stuff" is empty.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.688">This version corrects a small bug: the wrong text is selected when the syntax colorer changes.  This is a cosmetic bug only; the selected text will not be replaced when further typing occurs.

Unless major bugs are found, this will be the last version of Leo for several months.  I want to freeze the code so that I can work on the wxWindows version.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.689">This version is a major milestone in Leo's code.  Improvements were made throughout Leo's code in an attempt to correct an extremely hard-to-find bug that can cause data in body panes to be lost.  Only time will tell if the bug has, in fact, finally been eradicated.

This version also corrects a minor bug; icons in a newly cloned tree were not always drawn properly.  Also, the currently selected headline no longer changes if you click on the + or - icons that expand and contract headlines.  This new behavior is a result of simplifying the event handlers; I won't consider changing this behavior until it is clear that the data loss bug has finally been fixed.

Use this version of Leo with caution until the new code has been thoroughly tested.  New asserts will guard against silent data loss and other unexpected events.  I don't expect these asserts to fail, but then one never does...

The following lists the changes that were made the code.  You don't need to read the following details; they are provided only for completeness.

1.  Greatly simplified the event handlers.  This should have been done long ago.

The event handlers now handle _all_ aspects of switching tree nodes and updating data structures when the body pane changes.  In particular, this guarantees that tnodes are "synched" when the body pane changes.  This is a major simplification and a major improvement: it should no longer be possible to lose data once it appears in the body pane.

The reverse is not true: the code must still take care that the body pane is updated if tnodes are changed "by hand."  (This is typically done when new nodes are being created.  Such nodes are never the current node and so are not shown in the body pane.)  I re-checked all code to make sure this constraint is satisfied.

Removed synchVnodes and updateBodyPane methods.  These have always been the most error-prone methods in Leo.  Removing them was made possible because the global constraint that tnodes are up-to-date is now guaranteed by the event handlers.

Created a new updateSyntaxColorer routine, which is called when moving a node or changing its text might affect syntax coloring.  This routine can never affect tnodes.

2.  Removed reference counting from tnodes.  The new code deletes tnodes only during the read process.  After that, tnodes are never deleted.  This could be called a memory leak, but it ensures that tnodes can never be deleted out from under a vnode.  I don't this was ever the problem with losing data, and the new code makes sure that it can't be.

3.  Improved how icons are redrawn.  Event handlers now set the dirty bit when text changes, which simplifies matters.

4.  Added asserts to guard against silent data loss, unexpected calls to event handlers, and mismatches between vnodes and their commanders.

6.  Added the mCommands data member to vnodes.  This member ensures that the correct commander is returned by vnode::commands().  The old code got the commander by looking for the current window.  Conceivably this could have caused the wrong commander to be used in some cases.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.690">This version adds the following features:

1. Outline to noweb command.
2. Python scripts for finding and changing text in Leo outlines.
3. A Python method of the vnode class returning the commander corresponding to a vnode.
4. Documentation for Leo's import/export commands.

This may be the last version of Leo for a while; I am about to start work on a cross-platform wxWindows version of Leo.  However, bug reports and requests for new features are always welcome.

</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.691">The "Outline To Noweb" command converts the selected outline to a flat file containing noweb text.  The name of the root section is taken from the @root directive.  &lt;&lt;*&gt;&gt; is used if the @root directive is not followed by any file name.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.692">Leo's Python scripting does not support Leo's Find and Replace commands directly because these commands are interactive.  Calling these commands from a Python script would be clumsy.

Instead you can use the new find and change scripts to search and replace text.  These scripts use Python's powerful re module.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.693">The commands() method has been added to the Python vnode class.

c=v.commands()

This method returns the commander for the window containing v.  This method can be used to avoid passing commanders as arguments to vnode methods.  For example, given just v, we can call either of the following:

	v.commands().synchNode()
	v.commands().Repaint()</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.694">This version corrects a problem with the Save As command;  it worked only once!  That is, after the Save As command was executed the window's title would change, but a later Save command would change the file specified before the Save As command was executed.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.695">This version of Leo introduces Python scripting.  This is a major new addition to Leo.  See the new Chapter 7 of this documentation.  Python support still has rough edges; the next release will be cleaner.  Any suggestions for improvements to Leo's support for Python would be appreciated.

Alt-V now toggles the "View All Characters" option.  This is especially useful when editing Python code.

Besides Python support, a number of minor bug fixes have been made:

Added syntax coloring for try and catch to the C parsers.

Control-K, I now indents blocks of text uniformly, regardless of the language being syntax colored, and regardless of @nocolor and @color directives.  Similarly, Control-K, U now undents blocks of text.  The old keys, control-[ and control-] only worked when the current language was C and syntax coloring was enabled.

Removed the menu items that had the enter key as a shortcut.  The only way to create a new node now is with Control-I.  Using the enter key for a shortcut is not a good idea: it causes problems throughout the code.

Fixed a bug in forgiving compare.  The code that was calling compare_comments wasn't handling mismatched whitespace properly.

Got the Import command for Python working.  I found a bug in Tangle: in @silent mode we must always output a newline in the place of the function name.  Otherwise the Python indentation will be wrong.

The Untangle is now disabled when in @silent mode.  Nothing good can happen in that case!

Fixed a minor problem with the @path directive:  ff a _new_ file has not been saved we issue a warning, not an error if no path has been specified.  We can't really test the @root command for a path because the @root command may be found much later.  Fortunately, this warning will happen very rarely.  It's important, however, to warn that the file may be written to the standard directory if no path is specified in the @root command.  Otherwise, Leo's behavior would be quite confusing.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.696">This version corrects an oversight in the Flatten Outline command.  In order to recreate the outline structure it is not enough to know whether each node has children; you must also know how many children each node has.

The new version of the Flatten Outline command represents the outline the same way the Export MORE Text does:  a child headline is indented one tab more than its parent headline.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.697">The Tangle commands now examine all nodes, including cloned nodes that have previously been visited.  Previously, such nodes were skipped during tangling.  The new logic allows clones to represent code common to more than one unit. You can always insert an @ignore directive in an ancestor of a cloned node to prevent the node from being processed during tangling.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.698">Version 0.19 fixes some bugs and eliminates some problematic features of Leo.  Also, the role of CWEB mode has been documented more thoroughly.

The PC version of PC is feature complete.  I will release version 1.0 after people have played with this version for a while.

As always, I'll be happy to fix bugs or add urgently needed features.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.699">Fixed a bug that could result in Tangle outputting derived files in the wrong directory.

Tangle and Untangle now set the current directory using @path directive if it exists, otherwise the directory specified in the Preferences panel if it exists, otherwise the directory set by the Load or Save commands if it exists.  (The Save As and Save To never alter this directory.) Finally, a check to see if the @root directive specifies a full path.  If so, the current directory is not changed.

If none of these directories exists an error is raised so that no Tangling or Untangling is done.  This error can only occur if Tangling or Untangling a file that has just been created by the New command and never saved with the Save command.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.700">Added the @language html, @language perl and @language perlpod directives, and added HTML, Perl and Perl + POD items in the Preferences panel.

The HTML script is rudimentary at present.  Suggestions for improvement are welcome.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.701">The @cweb and @noweb commands are no longer functional.  The new @language cweb directive replaces @cweb, and the other @language directives effectively replace @noweb.  There is an new CWEB option in the Preference panel.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.702">Leo now parses the @language directive as you type, so if you change the language specified by the @language directive you will see the effect immediately.

There is no longer a limit of 6 languages that can be syntax colored. Let me know if you would like Leo to support another language.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.703">The Print command is now much more flexible and convenient: it will print any node and all its descendents, whether or not the node contains @unit, @root or @ignore directives.  
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.704">Modified massage_block_comment so that it converts the first of a series of newlines to a blank and deletes the rest; Untangle no longer mangles modified @doc sections.

A more complete solution would be for Tangle to insert a flag for inserted newlines ( say backslash newline) so that Untangle could know which newlines to remove.  I'd like to wait until all Tangle/Untangle code is converted to C++ before doing a more thorough job.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.705">Leo no longer supports clone _windows_.  Cloned outlines, however, will remain with Leo forever.  

Clone windows were never very useful and were buggy.  Eliminating clone windows has made it possible to handle events more smoothly and powerfully.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.706">The Extended Noweb Syntax option in the Preferences panel is gone.  This option has always been deprecated.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.707"></t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.708">Version 0.18 changes the file format in an upward compatible way.  That is, version 0.18 can read all previous versions of Leo files, but you must have version 0.18 of Leo to read files written by version 0.18.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.709">Fixed a bug that caused @doc section not to be output properly for those languages like Fortran and Perl that do not have block comments.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.710">The @noheader directive suppresses the header line normal written by Tangle at the start of each derived file.  The @noheader directive is especially useful in Perl.  Also added the corresponding "Tangle outputs header line" checkbox in the preferences panel.  This checkbox sets the default which may be over-ridden by the @header or @noheader directives.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.711">@language fortran specifies that comments start with C.
@language fortran90 specifies that comments start with !.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.712">@language perlpod specifies the Perl language with block comments being delimited by =pod and =cut</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.713">Version 0.17 fixes some bugs and puts some finishing touches on Leo.

The Borland C++ Builder version of Leo is now feature complete; there are no further items on the to-do list.  Yes, I'll be happy to fix bugs or add urgently needed features.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.714">Tangle and Untangle now treat &lt;&lt;*&gt;&gt;= as a synonym for @root filename if the _headline_ starts with text of the form @root filename.  This convention allows full compatibility with noweb.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.715">The @path, @tabwidth and @pagewidth directives are new.

These directives allow the user to override the defaults specified in the Prefs panel on a file-by-file basis.   For the first time, every option in the Preferences panel may be overridden by a directive.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.716">I fixed several severe bugs involving CWEB mode.  It is now possible to tangle and untangle files when in CWEB mode, though CWEB mode has still not been tested thoroughly.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.717">Reduced the default size of Leo windows so that they can be more easily resized on a small screen.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.718">Version 0.16 is a significant new release of Leo.  All users of the PC version of Leo should upgrade to version 0.16.

Significant changes have been made to Tangle and Untangle:  these commands should now be able to handle code in almost any language.  The new @language directive specifies the comment and string conventions used when Tangling and Untangling.

The @verbose, @terse and @silent directives are new:  they control how Tangle outputs comments.

The Import Files command now handles Pascal, Python and Java files in addition to C and C++ files.

Besides the major changes a number of bug fixes and other minor features have been added.

Acknowledgements:  Thanks to Zak Greant for numerous suggestions and bug fixes, and to Garold Johnson for improving this file.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.719">Version 0.16 fixes all bugs mentioned on the SourceForge site as of April 27, 2000.  These bugs involved problems with

@comment &lt;empty&gt;
@comment 2 delims
Not inheriting @comment properly
non-delimited filenames in @root directives
Crashes while Tangling
Problems with Untangle with languages other than C.

Later sections discuss some of these in more detail.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.720">Version 0.16 fixes a crasher related to changing windows.

This _may_ have been the source of crashes when cutting and pasting outlines, but don't count on it!  Make sure you back up files _before_ cutting and pasting outlines!</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.721">The @language directive is new.  The @language directive actually specifies the comment delimiters and string types used by the Tangle and Untangle.

The form of this directive is

@language x

where x is one of the following: c,c++,html,java,objective-c,pascal,perl,python and shell.  Shell files have comments that start with #.  Case is ignored in the language specifiers, but not in the @language itself.  Thus, the following are equivalent:

@language html
@language HTML
@language hTmL

but the following is invalid:

@LANGUAGE html

The @comment directive is now officially deprecated: you should use the @language directive whenever possible.  At present Untangle will not process an @root or @unit node if an @comment directive is in effect.  Why?  Because Untangle can't be sure of properly parsing a derived file if the language of the derived file isn't known.  It might be possible to assume some defaults in this case, but that is not done at present and is not a high priority.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.722">Scanning for @directives is now much faster.  As a result, the @language and @comment directives will be recognized anywhere in an outline.  This means

1) child nodes will "inherit" @language or @comment directives from ancestors unless over-ridden in the child node and

2) @language and @comment directives need not be placed in @unit or @root nodes.  This is a much more intuitive and powerful way of handling these directives.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.723">Key parts of the untangle logic have been generalized so that they can handle essentially any computer language. The following routines no longer have any C-specific code and have essentially been completely rewritten:

scan_derived_file (formerly scan_c_file)
forgiving_compare (formerly c_compare)

Tangle now will properly output comments using the present comment delimiters as specified by either the @language directive or the @comment directive.  As mentioned before, you should use @language instead of @comment wherever possible.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.724">As a side effect of the Untangle command, Leo now removes trailing blank lines from the body text of all nodes being untangled.  This finally crushes a long-standing bug.  If the body text ends with one or more blank lines, the altered body text contains exactly one trailing newline.

Nodes that are altered in this way are not marked, nor is the file-changed mark set.  This seems to be the most appropriate action to take:  it would be confusing to prompt the user to save a changed file if the only changes involve trailing whitespace.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.725">The @verbose, @terse and @silent directives determine how Tangle outputs comments.  When @verbose is in effect Tangle outputs all comments.  When @terse is in effect, Tangle outputs only those comments necessary for Untangle to work.  When @silent is in effect Tangle no additional comments.  Note: comments written by the user in code sections are always output: these directives control only:

1.  The comments containing doc chunks and
2.  Sentinel comments that delimit the beginning and end of code chunks.

@verbose is the default.  If more than one of these directives appear in the same body text the "most verbose" of these options will be in effect.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.726">At long last Leo has a useful notion of default directory.  By default, the default directory is the directory containing the .leo file.  This may be over-ridden using the "Tangle Default Directory" option in the Preferences panel.

The default directory is used whenever a file name in an @root directive contains no path component.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.727">The Import Files command looks at the file extension to see how it should handle files.

Extension	Language
.c			C
.cpp		C++
.java		Java
.pas		Pascal
.py			Python

If the extension is not one of the above the Import files commands merely puts the entire file into the body text of a single node.

The Import Files command probably needs quite a bit of work.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.728">Control-T now changes the pane that is currently active.  If the outline pane was active, the body pane becomes active, and vice versa.  This command makes it possible to switch between panes without using the mouse.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.729">In previous versions of leo.leo I used slash instead of backslash as path delimiters.  This should never have worked, but somehow it did.  The present code uses the correct backslash in all @root directives.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.730">Many improvements were made to the code.  See the diary section of leo.leo if you are interested.  In particular, I created args.h and args.c to define arguments.  This cleans up the code quite a bit.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.731">Changed Tangle and Untangle so that empty section names like &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;= are treated as ordinary characters.  No warning is issued, which is debatable.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.732">As mentioned in the main documentation, you must not change sentinel lines in derived files in any way.  In particular, if you change the section name in a sentinel line Untangle will not update the code in the outline (with the old name) that generated the renamed section.  Untangle now warns about sections that appear in a derived file but not in the outline.  Untangle has no trouble with changed section references in derived files; it is only changed sentinel lines that cause problems.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.733">Leo is being used to develop HTML files for web sites.  In this context it is natural to define sections that are shared between files.  Don't expect Untangle to update such sections if you make changes to them in derived files.  The natural place to change sections shared by several roots is in the outline, not in the files derived from the outline.

If you do change code in a derived file that appears in several derived files, and try to use Untangle to update the code in the outline one of two things will happen:

1) You untangle an @root node.  Untangle will never compare examine the common section of code for changes, as the common section appear under a @unit node, not the @root node. Untangle will complain about an orphan node.
 
2) You untangle an @unit node.  Untangle will examine each @root node under the @unit node.  Unless the change is made in the last root examined, Untangle will propagate the change when it first sees it, then go right ahead and undo the change when it sees the next expansion of the node in a derived file.
 
Untangle tests for inconsistent expansions of a section only within a single derived file.  Such tests are not done between different derived files because we do not want disallow sections with the same names in different roots.</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.734">Known bugs and limitations in all versions of Leo.

1. Untangle has no way of updating a section(chunk) whose name has been changed in the derived file.  Because of the @unit directive, there is not even a way to issue a meaningful warning.

2. Tangle treats @c like @code when in CWEB mode.
I recommend changing @c to @&lt; c @&gt;= throughout your CWEB sources and adding a reference
to @&lt; c @&gt; in all roots of CWEB files.

Known bugs and limitations of the PC version of Leo.

Syntax coloring options are not saved to the file.

The Log window has a limited capacity. This mainly affects debugging traces but could affect the output from the Tangle or Untangle commands if you tangled or untangled a large number of files.
</t>
<t tx="edream.110203163054.833">The Execute Script command executes body text as a Python script.  Leo execute the selected text, or the entire body text if no text is selected.

Scripts are executed in a "pristine" environment, that is, with __builtins__ as both the local and global environments.

New in version 4.1:  Body text may now contain @directives and section references. This is a major step forward: you can now use all of Leo's features to organize scripts that you execute interactively.

Section definitions must appear in the node containing the script or in descendant nodes.  Leo "preprocesses" all scripts by simulating the writing of a derived file to a string.

2. Leo handle's conflicts in most code just as any editor would:  Leo body pane shows the conflict delimited as usual.

3. Leo can read @thin files with conflicts that span sentinels.  This affects the outline structure, but not as severely as one might think.  Such conflicts would typically result from two developers changing the headline of a node in conflicting ways.  This will happen rarely, and the workarounds are straightforward.</t>

About merging / CVS etc: 

Perhaps it helps to think about the big picture a bit, I mean about what do we really want / is practical. 

CVS is a de facto standard on the internet for collaboration, so being compatible is highly desirable. Unfortunately CVS has a series of shortcomings, particularly for Leo. 

CVS merges on a line-by-line basis, so interdependencies of code are ignored (I think all other tools I know of do the same). Now, I believe this is ok for large sets of files, where multiple changes to the same function or file are rare. Using CVS to merge only single Leo nodes (body text) would be rather silly though: Mostly these texts are short (a page or so) and one single function (or less). Multiple changes in such a code snippet are likely to be interdependent, and I would rather like to look at the different texts rather than have them merged automatically. 

On the other hand, I don't mind if the versioning or merging tool at hand allows me to update any nodes I did not touch myself. So rather than CVS-like merging, I would like to see which nodes are being affected by the change, then have it done automatically for those nodes I don't worry about, but by hand (or interactively) for those I changed myself too, or for those I worry about, because they are related to my own changes. 

In other words, I would like to see a merge tool, that understands versions, can tell me which nodes in a Leo file have changed, remembers which changes I made myself, and gives me the choice, tree branch by tree branch, to automatically accept the changes, or screen them interactively. 

I think Leo should have such a tool built-in.

This is the fifth release of the reorganized 4.1 code base.

For the first time in months there are no serious bugs outstanding.

Warning: By default Leo 4.1 creates .leo files that can not be read by older versions of Leo.

Warning: Use the __wx_gui.py plugin with extreme caution until further notice:
bugs in this plugin could cause body text to be cleared improperly when changing nodes.

Beta 5:
  * Leo runs in batch mode when invoked with --script aScriptFile.py
    - Created "null gui" classes that do not use any gui code.
  * Leo supports Unicode characters (e.g. Chinese) in path and file names.
  * Fixed several long-standing bugs:
    - Fixed several minor problems with the Extract Section and Import commands.
    - Fixed problem that prevent the Find panel from working on the Mac.
    - Improved @url handling so that @url file:\\path\x.leo works properly.
    - Improved support for @lineending platform.
    - Leo honors outline/body pane ratio when opening .leo files.
    - Leo now ensures that newly-opened windows fit entirely on the screen.
    - Fixed a crasher when Undoing a Change All command when searching headlines.
  - Fixed other bugs resulting from the 4.1 reorg:
    - Fixed problem loading plugins on Linux.
    - Fixed crashers in the Extract Section and Extract commands.
    - Fixed a crasher when writing a file containing an undefined section.
    - Removed duplicate bindings in popup menus.
    - Made sure to show Leo's windows in wx gui plugin.

Beta 4:
  - Fixed several "reorg" bugs, some of which affected plugins.
  - Allow @directives and section references when executing scripts!
  - More than one section reference may now appear on the same line.
  - Use "utf-8" encoding for filenames under MacOS (Darwin)
  - Allow command or cmnd prefix for menu shortcuts under Darwin.
	  
Beta 3:
  - Completed the reorg, making many changes to the code base.
  - Fixed a LaTeX coloring bug

Beta 2:
  - Fixed a startup problem on Linux: the "mbcs" text encoding is not valid on Linux.

Beta 1:
  * Script-based find/change commands.
  - Hoist &amp; DeHoist commands for viewing parts of an outline.
  - Check Outline command finds user clone mistakes.
  * New configuration settings:
    - use_gnx specifies whether .leo files use integers as indices:
      use_gnx = 0 makes .leo files compatible with previous versions of Leo.
      use_gnx = 1 makes .leo files cvs-friendly
    - config_encoding specifies the encoding of leoConfig.txt.
  * Several significant code-level changes:
    - The 4.1 code base has been reorganized to support gui plugins.
    - An example wx_gui plugin is partly functional.
    - Created a flexible framework for creating &amp; running regression tests.
    - app.forceShutdown now works when called from plugins.</t>

New in 4.1: Leo now supports scripts in Leo's Find/Change dialog.

Leo's find panel now contains the Script Search radio button and the Script
Change checkbox. When the Script Search radio button is selected Leo treats the
contents of the Search Text as a script to execute whenever any kind of Find
command is executed. Similarly, when the Script Change checkbox is selected Leo
treats the context of the Change Text as a script to execute whenever any kind
of Change command is executed. See below for just how this works.

Script-based find-change is extremely powerful. In effect, Leo's Find/Change
panel becomes a new platform for running scripts interactively. Leo now has all
the find/change capability of pattern matching languages like Snobol and Icon,
just by using the capabilities of the plain Python language. Moreover, Leo can
deliver these capabilities interactively or not depending which buttons you push
in Leo's Find/Change panel.

Script-based find/change frees the user from having to control script-based
searches interactively. Rather than forcing find/change scripts to implement
their own interactive controls, it is much easier to use what Leo already has.</t>

<t tx="edream.111803060152.1">Leo dedicates a Python dictionary called app.searchDict for communication
between Leo and the search and change scripts. The search and change scripts may
also use app.searchDict for communication between themselves. Leo sets
app.searchDict["type"] to "find", "change", "findAll" or "changeAll" to indicate
the kind of command being executed. Scripts may use all other entries in
app.searchDict as they please.

Leo executes the find script once when you press the Find button (or the Change
then Find button) in Leo's Find/Change dialog. Typically, the find script would
traversing the tree and highlight the found text or otherwise indicate to the
user that the find operation has succeeded. However, the script can do anything
it pleases.

Leo executes the the find script repeatedly when you press the Find All button.
Leo keeps executing the find script until app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates
to false. Initially there is no entry for app.searchDict["continue"], so the
find script must set app.searchDict["continue"] = true if it wants Leo to keep
executing it.

Leo executes the change script once when you press the Change button. Typically,
the change script would change the selected text. Usually the change script will
compute the new value of body text and call c.setBodyString(p,newText) to
make that change permanent. 

The change script also may handle undo, typically by calling
c.frame.onBodyChanged(v,"Change",oldText=oldText). Leo does not handle undo
automatically. Indeed, Leo makes no assumptions whatever about what the change
script really does.

Leo executes the the change script repeatedly when you press the Change All
button. Just as with the Find All command, Leo keeps executing the change script
until app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates to false.

Most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find Panel like "whole
word", "pattern match", and "reverse". However, these settings are available to
the scripts via ivars such as c.whole_word_flag, etc. if desired.</t>
<t tx="edream.111803060152.2">@nocolor

Some ideas for using scripts:
	
Either the find and change scripts may use Python's re module.  For
example, the find script could set app.searchDict["m"] to the match object
returned by re's match method.  The change script would then compute the
result, change the text and set the undo info as usual.

There is no reason to confine find/change scripts to operate on data only
within a Leo outline. These scripts could as easily traverse your file system
as the Leo outline. But notice: scripts could pull data from the file system
into the outline so that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts
operate. Again, this can all happen interactively if you like.</t>

@  New in version 4.1: On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form --script scriptFile.  If found, Leo enters batch mode.

In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.  Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of that file using Leo's Execute Script command.  By default, Leo sends all output to Leo's log pane to the console window.  Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable this output by calling app.log.disable() or app.log.enable()

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the Edit Body and Edit Headline commands.  Those commands require interaction with the user.

For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the headlines in that file.
@c

import leoGlobals as g

path = r"c:\prog\leoCVS\leo\test\test.leo"

g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.

<t tx="edream.120703073611.1">@nocolor

We wish to avoid the possibility that two plugins might unwittingly choose the same name for attributes in the unknownAttributes or tempAttributes dictionaries.  The following convention eliminates that possibility.

Each plugin should create its own dictionary _inside_ any tempAttributes or unknownAttributes dictionaries that it intends to create or modify.  Something like this:

@color

# Create the tempAttributes dict for this vnode.
if not v.hasattr("tempAttributes"):
	v.tempAttributes = {}

# Create a subdictionary for the private use of my plugin.
d = v.tempAttributes.get("myPluginName")
if d is None:
	v.tempAttributes["myPluginName"] = d = {}

@nocolor

Now the plugin can set and get fields in d.  Similar code would be used for the t.tempAttributes, v.unknownAttributes and t.unknownAttributes dictionaries.</t>

The Scripts node in LeoPy.leo contains a script called initScriptFind.  This script makes it easy to set up script based searches as follows:

1. Put the following code in the root of a tree that will contain your script search:

@color
# Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
from leoGlobals import *
initScriptFind("Find script","Change script") # Second argument is optional.
# Start searching at the top.
top().selectVnode(c.rootVnode())
@nocolor

2. Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes).

3. (Optional) Put the change script in a child node called "Change script"

4.  Execute the code above.  Leo does the following:

- Puts the body of the "Find script" into the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Puts the body of the "Change script" into the change text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Selects the Script Find radio button.
- Selects the Script Change checkbox if the change script exists.
- Selects the root of the entire outline.

Presto!  Leo is ready for a script search.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040201114855.3">This plugin uses Leo and docutils to mix program code and reST documentation.

The Python docutils package must be installed.http://docutils.sourceforge.net

If SilverCity is installed (http://silvercity.sourceforge.net) the plugin
produces HTML output that is syntax colored.

The basic approach is that any Leo node that contains program code that needs
documentation (in an ideal world it would be every node) has an associated child
node whose headline is simply '@rst', that contains reST-style documentation.
While this means that a typical program may have dozens (if not hundreds) of
these @rst nodes, it produces documentation that I think is as close as I have
ever seen to useful, easy-to-read documentation that is easy to create at the
same time as an application is being coded.

There are several interrelated aspects to this work:

- The reST plugin (renamed rst2) was hacked to manage Leo outlines that were a
combination of normal code nodes and reSt nodes.

- The plugin now recognizes a @rst directive (that has no associated file name)
in the headline of a node.

- When it encounters such a @rst Headline node, it writes the contents of the
body of the @rst node's *parent* (which generally contains program code) to the
reST output file (HTML) and then adds the reST content that is contained in the
body of the @rst documentation node to the output HTML file,

- These @rst nodes are used in @file-nosent trees and the @rst nodes have an 
@ignore directive (plus @nocolor directive and @wrap directives) so that 
when the @file is updated the application code does not contain the reST-style
documentation contained in the body of the @rst nodes. (This was the reason I
had asked you in the Leo Forum to allow @file-nosent trees to work appropriately
with @ignore nodes - Thank you for doing this right away.) There is no reason
that the reST content couldn't be written to the 
@file as documentation other than I personally believe in a volume of 
documentation (including musings, failed ideas, questions, etc.) that is 
probably best kept separate from the actual *.py files.

- When you double-click on a plain rst node (no associated filename) Leo opens
both the @rst documentation node and the parent node containing code in an
external editor *simultaneously*. I happen to use Textpad and so the code is
opened with python syntax coloring in one Textpad window and right next to it is
the reST documentation. This makes it much much easier to code and do
documentation at the same time. (Note that the plugin assumes that the python
extension is '.tp' since that is what I use with TextPad.)

So why is this a big deal?

For the first time in my experience the documentation process:

1) is completely in sync with the process of code development.

2) allows the programmer to write as much documentation as he/she wants without
the programming code becoming unreadable because of what would be considered
excessive or intrusive documentation. (This applies whether documentation is
intended for external consumption or just so a solo programmer can remember what
he/she was thinking...)

My conclusion is that Leo + reST/docutils provides the perfect platform for
optimal documentation. I have never completely understood what is meant by
Literate Programming but in my mind this is practical Literate Programming.

Frankly, I think this is all a minor miracle but maybe I've lost perspective.

A search box which behaves like a web site search is added, along with a "GO"
button to do quick searches right from the main Leo window. All the current
search options are retained except that "search body text" is explicitly set -
mainly because this is by far the most common use case.

Pressing &lt;CR&gt; while editing the text automatically does a search. Repeated
searches can be done by clicking the "GO" button.

The combo box also stores a list of previous searches, which can be selected to
quickly repeat a search. When activating a previous search the original search
mode is used.

The documentation for encoding lines at

C:\Python23\Doc\Python-Docs-2.3.1\whatsnew\section-encodings.html

states:

"Encodings are declared by including a specially formatted comment in the
first or second line of the source file."

In fact, contrary to the implication, the Python 2.3 parser does not look
for lines of the form:

# -*- coding: &lt;encoding&gt; -*-

For example, Python improperly scans the following line for an encoding

#@+leo-ver=4-encoding=iso-8859-1.

and reports that iso-8859-1. (note trailing dot) is an invalid encoding!

The workaround for my app is to precede this line with the following line:

# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-

This makes Python 2.3 happy.

To make myself perfectly clear: Python has absolutely no right to complain

####################################
Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python
####################################

This chapter is a tutorial describing how to write Python scripts that get and
modify data contained in Leo outlines. Scripts use Leo's, **vnode**, **tnode**
and **position** classes to access data in Leo outlines. The combination of a
vnode v and its tnode v.t represents a node's data. Leo needs both vnodes and
tnodes to represent clones efficiently. Indeed, a tnode represents all data
shared by cloned nodes. When Leo clones a vnode v, Leo creates a new,
independent vnode v2 and sets v2.t == v.t. Thus, cloning a node does not
duplicate any information in descendant trees, but descendants of a cloned node
appear more than once on the screen (when all nodes are expanded). Positions
represent a node at a particular place on the screen. Equivalently, a position
indicates a particular place in a tree traversal. Iterators of the position
class define various kinds of tree traversals.

Leo's execute-script command predefines several symbols.  This makes it easy to
access the data in Leo outlines and the Leo's own source code. g is predefined
to the leoGlobals module. Scripts commonly use utility functions such as g.es,
g.trace, etc. The g.app object represents Leo itself. The instance vars (ivars)
of g.app are Leo's global variables and constants. The execute-script command
predefines c to be the commander (see below) of the Leo outline in which the
script is contained. Whenever possible, scripts should use the high-level
methods of the commander to insert, delete or clone nodes. Finally, the
execute-script commands predefines p to be the presently selected position.

This chapter describes only some of Leo's functions, classes and methods.
However, your scripts have complete access to all of Leo's source code, that
is, all the code in ``LeoPy.leo``. You are not limited by what you see in this
chapter.

<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.3">The g.es method prints its arguments to the Log tab of the log pane::

    g.es("Hello world")

g.es converts non-string arguments using repr::

    g.es(c)

g.es prints multiple arguments separated by commas::

    g.es("Hello","world")

To create a tab named 'Test' or make it visible if it already exists::
 
    c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')

When first created, a tab contains a Tk.Text widget.
To write to this widget, add the tabName argument to g.es::

    g.es('Test',color='blue',tabName='Test')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.5">``leoGlobals.py`` defines 6 convenience methods for redirecting stdout and stderr::

    g.redirectStderr() # Redirect stderr to the current log pane.
    g.redirectStdout() # Redirect stdout to the current log pane.
    g.restoreStderr()  # Restores stderr so it prints to the console window.
    g.restoreStdout()  # Restores stdout so it prints to the console window.
    g.stdErrIsRedirected() # Returns True if the stderr stream is redirected to the log pane.
    g.stdOutIsRedirected() # Returns True if the stdout stream is redirected to the log pane.

Calls need *not* be paired. Redundant calls are ignored and the last call made
controls where output for each stream goes.
**Note**: you must execute Leo in a console window to see non-redirected output from the print statement::

    print "stdout isRedirected:", g.stdOutIsRedirected()
    print "stderr isRedirected:", g.stdErrIsRedirected()

    g.redirectStderr()
    print "stdout isRedirected:", g.stdOutIsRedirected()
    print "stderr isRedirected:", g.stdErrIsRedirected()

    g.redirectStdout()
    print "stdout isRedirected:", g.stdOutIsRedirected()
    print "stderr isRedirected:", g.stdErrIsRedirected()

    g.restoreStderr()

    p = c.currentPosition() # get the current position.
    g.es(p)

    g.es("body:",p.bodyString())

Here is how to access data at position ``p``.
**Note**: these methods work whether or not ``p`` is the current position::

    body = p.bodyString()
    head = p.headString()
    c.setBodyString(p,body) # set body text of p to body.
    c.setHeadString(p,head) # set headline text of p to head.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.9">The proper way to traverse an outline is with an iterator.
Iterators are defined only by the position class;

This script makes a list of all the nodes in an outline::

    nodes = [p for p in c.allNodes_iter()]
    g.es("This outline contains %d nodes" % len(nodes))

Here is one way to count the nodes of an outline::

    count = 0
    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        count += 1
    g.es("This outline contains %d nodes" % count)

Here is a way to count the *distinct* vnodes of an outline::

    positions = 0 ; tnodes = {}
    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        positions += 1
        if not tnodes.get(p.v.t):
            tnodes[p.v.t] = p.v.t

    g.es("%8s vnodes" % len(tnodes.keys()))</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.13">The ``p.children_iter`` iterator returns a list of all children of position ``p``::

    parent = p.parent()
    g.es("children of %s" % parent.headString(),color="purple")
    for p in parent.children_iter():
        g.es(p.headString())</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.14">The ``p.parents_iter`` iterator returns a list of all parents of position ``p``, excluding ``p``::

    g.es("inclusive parents of %s" % current.headString(),color="purple")
    for p in current.self_and_parents_iter():
        g.es(p.headString())

The ``p.self_and_parents_iter`` iterator returns a list of all parents of position ``p``, including ``p``::

    current = p.copy()
    g.es("exclusive of %s" % current.headString(),color="purple")
    for p in current.parents_iter():

    for p in current.following_siblings_iter():
        g.es(p.headString())</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.16">The p.subtree_iter iterator returns a list of all positions in ``p``'s subtree, excluding ``p``::

    g.es("exclusive subtree of %s" % parent.headString(),color="purple")
    for p in parent.subtree_iter():
        g.es(p.headString())

The p.self_and_subtree_iter iterator returns a list of all positions in ``p``'s subtree, including ``p``::

    parent = p.parent()

        g.es(p.headString())</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.17">You can use ``c.redraw_now`` to redraw the entire screen immediately::

    c.redraw_now()

However, Leo's code redraws the screen using the following pattern::
    
    c.beginUpdate()
    try:
        &lt;&lt; whatever &gt;&gt;
    finally:
        c.endUpdate()

This suppresses redraws inside &lt;&lt;whatever&gt;&gt; that would otherwise be caused by
``c.endUpdate``. ``c.endUpdate`` takes an optional argument::

    c.endUpdate(flag)

redraws the screen only if flag is True. This is an important pattern. Leo uses
``c.beginUpdate`` and ``c.endUpdate`` almost everywhere to redraw the screen, so
provided that &lt;&lt; whatever &gt;&gt; contains no calls to ``c.redraw_now`` this pattern
insures that at most one redraw occurs.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.18">Leo dispatches commands using c.doCommand,
which calls the "command1" and "command2" hook routines for the given label.
c.doCommand catches all exceptions thrown by the command::

    c.doCommand(c.markHeadline,label="markheadline")

You can also call command handlers directly so that hooks will not be called::

    c.markHeadline()

You can invoke minibuffer commands by name.  For example::

    c.executeMinibufferCommand('open-outline')

c.keyHandler.funcReturn contains the value returned from the command.
In many cases, as above, this value is simply 'break'.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.19">Each commander maintains its own preferences.
Your scripts can get the following ivars::

    ivars = (
        'output_doc_flag',
        'page_width',
        'page_width',
        'tab_width',
        'tangle_batch_flag',
        'tangle_directory',
        'target_language',
        'untangle_batch_flag',
        'use_header_flag',
    )
    
    g.es("Prefs ivars...\n",color="purple")
    for ivar in ivars:
        g.es(getattr(c,ivar))

If your script sets ``c.tab_width`` your script may call ``f.setTabWidth`` to redraw the screen::

    c.tab_width = -4    # Change this and see what happens.
    c.frame.setTabWidth(c.tab_width)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.21">The file ``leoFindScript.py`` contains functions for finding and changing text
from within scripts.  See ``leoFindScript.py`` in ``LeoPy.leo`` for full details.

The findall function returns a list of tuples ``(v,pos)`` describing matches in
``c``'s entire tree::

    import leoFindScript

    pattern="import leoGlobals as g"
    result = leoFindScript.findAll(c,pattern,bodyFlag=1)
    
    g.es("%-3d instances of: '%s'...\n" % (len(result),pattern),color="purple")
    
    for v,pos in result:
        body = v.bodyString()
        g.es('\n%-4d %s' % (pos,v.headString()))
        g.es(g.get_line_after(body,pos))

The ``reFindall`` function returns a list of tuples ``(v,mo,pos)``, where ``mo``
is a ``MatchObject``. The ``reFlags`` argument are flags to ``re.search``::

    import leoFindScript

    pattern="from .* import"
    result = leoFindScript.reFindAll(c,pattern,bodyFlag=1,reFlags=None)

    g.es("%-3d instances of: '%s'...\n" % (len(result),pattern),color="purple")

<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.24">On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form::

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's ``Execute Script`` command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling ``app.log.disable`` or ``app.log.enable``

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the ``Edit Body``
and ``Edit Headline`` commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"c:\prog\leoCVS\leo\test\test.leo"
   
    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)

<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.25">``leoGlobals.py`` contains many utility functions and constants.
The following script prints all the names defined in ``leoGlobals.py``::

    g.es("Names defined in leoGlobals.py",color="purple")

<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.26">Most scripts will use methods of the position class to access information in an
outline. The following sections summarizes the most useful methods that your
scripts can use. For a complete list, see the ``leoNodes.py`` in of ``LeoPy.leo``.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.27">Here are the most useful getters of the ``vnode`` and ``position`` classes.
    
Returning strings::

    p.bodyString() # the body string of p.
    p.headString() # the headline string of p.
    
Returning ints::

    p.childIndex()
    p.numberOfChildren()
    p.level()
    
Returning bools representing property bits::

    p.hasChildren()
    p.isAncestorOf(v2) # True if v2 is a child, grandchild, etc. of p.
    p.isCloned()
    p.isDirty()
    p.isExpanded()
    p.isMarked()
    p.isVisible()
    p.isVisited()</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403173920.28">Here are the most useful setters of the ``Commands`` and ``position`` classes.
The following setters of the ``position`` class regardless of whether
``p`` is the presently selected position::

    c.setBodyString(p,s)  # Sets the body text of p.
    c.setHeadString(p,s)  # Sets the headline text of p.

Moving nodes::

    p.moveAfter(v2)           # move p after v2
    p.moveToNthChildOf(v2,n)  # move p to the n'th child of v2
    p.moveToRoot(oldRoot)     # make p the root position.
                              # oldRoot must be the old root position if it exists.

The "visited" bit may be used by commands or scripts for any purpose.
Many commands use this bits for tree traversal, so these bits do not persist::

    c.clearAllVisited() # Clears all visited bits in c's tree.
    p.clearVisited()
    p.setVisited()</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403175157.1">The windowlist attribute of the application instance contains the list of the
frames of all open windows. The commands ivar of the frame gives the commander
for that frame::

    windows = g.app.windowList # get the list of all open frames.
    g.es("windows...")
    for f in windows:
        c = f.c # c is f's commander
        g.es(f)
        g.es(f.shortFileName())
        g.es(c)
        g.es(c.rootPosition())</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040403183229">Leo's source code is a collection of classes, along with utility functions in
``leoGlobals.py``. Here are the classes and objects that scripts will commonly use:

**g.app**
    The **application object** representing the entire Leo application.
    The ivars (instance variables) of ``g.app`` represent Leo's global variables.
    
**g.app.gui**
    This is a wrapper class that shields Leo's core code from gui-dependent details.
    As described below, scripts can invoke dialogs using g.app.gui convenience methods.

**commander**
    An instance of the ``Commands`` class in ``leoCommands.py``.
    Commanders represent commands for a *particular* window.
    Each open Leo window has its own commander.
    By convention, any variable named ``c`` is a commander.

**frame**
    An instance of the base ``leoFrame`` class in ``leoFrame.py``.
    Frames contains all the internal data needed to manage a Leo window.
    Given a commander ``c``, ``c.frame`` is commanders frame.
    Given a frame ``f``, ``f.c`` is the frame's commander.

**position**
    An instance of the ``position`` class in ``leoNodes.py``.
    A position object represents the location of a particular node *in a tree traversal*.
    By convention, variables named ``p``, ``p1`` or ``p2`` are positions.
    For any ``position`` ``p``, ``p.v`` is the vnode at that position and
    ``p.v.t`` is the tnode at that position.
    **Positions are the primary way to access data.**
    ``c.currentPosition`` and ``c.rootPosition`` return positions.
    From those starting point, it is possible to access the data in any node.

    **Important**:
    Positions can become *invalid* when the structure of the outline changes.
    As discussed below, plugins and scripts that store positions for use at a later time should make sure the
    position p is still valid by calling c.positionExists(p)

    **Important**:
    For compatibility with old (pre-4.2) scripts, ``c.currentVnode`` and
    ``c.rootVnode`` methods return *positions* not vnodes. Old scripts appear to
    be using vnodes; in fact they are using positions. I call such scripts
    **confused** scripts. Confused scripts work because the ``position`` class
    is designed to make them work. We'll see how this works in detail in `About
    copying positions`_.  This section is **supremely important**.

**vnode**
    An instance of the ``vnode`` class in ``leoNodes.py``.
    vnodes represent one or more outline nodes on the screen.
    Normally, scripts access vnodes via the ``position`` class described below. 
    By convention, variables named ``v``, ``v1`` or ``v2`` refer to vnodes.
    **Important**: scripts normally should use positions, not vnodes.

**tnode**
    An instance of the ``tnode`` class in ``leoNodes.py``.
    tnodes represent the actual data in a vnode, including headline and body text.
    For any vnode ``v``, ``v.t`` is v's tnode.
    Cloned vnodes v1 and v2 share the same tnode.  That is ``v1.t == v2``.
    **Important**: If ``p`` is a ``position``, ``p.v.t`` is the tnode associated with that position.
    Many positions may share the same tnode.
    
**Important**: With the exception of the p.v and v.t ivars, scripts should be
careful to use only the methods of the position, vnode and tnode classes rather
than the internal ivars of these classes. Doing so will ensure that the script
is as simple as possible and that the script will continue to work regardless of
future changes to the internals of these classes.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040411151245">Iterators exist only in the position class::

	c.allNodes_iter            # returns all positions in c's outline.
	p.children_iter            # returns all children of p.
	p.parents_iter             # returns all parents of p.
	p.self_and_parents_iter    # returns p and all parents of p.
	p.siblings_iter            # returns all siblings of p, including p.
	p.following_siblings_iter  # returns all siblings following p.
	p.subtree_iter             # returns all positions in p's subtree, excluding p.
	p.self_and_subtree_iter    # returns all positions in p's subtree, including p.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040414172218.2">Leo_ has thousands of users_. Like me, many of them would never willingly be without Leo again.
Here are Leo's essential features:

1.  Leo outlines_ show you the big picture at all times,
    while providing unlimited space for details.

2.  Leo outlines_ can organize any kind of data:
    computer programs, web sites, documentation, pictures, whatever.

3.  Clones_ allow multiple views of the data within a *single* outline_.
    You don't have to choose the 'correct' view; you can see data in many ways.

4.  Plugins_ allow Leo's users to add new features to Leo.
    Many of Leo's most successful features started life this way.

5.  Leo is a superb scripting_ environment for Python.
    Scripts contained in a Leo outline_ have easy access to all the outline's data.
    It is natural to organize Leo outlines to make life easier for scripts.

6.  Leo is `Open Software`_, written in 100% pure Python_.
    Leo runs wherever Python does.

Leo has a strong and active community of users on `SourceForge`_.
Working with this community has been a constant source of joy and inspiration.
Suggestions and plugins from users continue to drive Leo in excellent new directions.
Who knows what the next plugin will bring? -- Edward K. Ream, September, 2005</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040705111716"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20040705111716.1">Leo will write only t.unknownAttributes to the .leo file when writing the &lt;v&gt; element corresponding to the root of an @thin tree.  Leo will do this by writing a new xml attribute, say descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, in &lt;v&gt; element.

The reason that Leo will only write t.unknownAttributes and not v.unknownAttributes is that only tnodes have gnx's in thin derived files.  In effect, vnodes are anonymous.  We could attempt to get around this by identifying vnodes by their corresponding tnodes, but that's not a general solution and it is, in effect, equivalent to writing only t.unknownAttributes.  This being so, it seems pointless to "pretend" to be writing v.unknownAttributes.

The effect of this is to make all vnodes identical, as far as using unknownAttributes is concerned.  As I've stated in the past, this won't do if, for example, a plugin is trying create an arbitrary directed graph between vnodes.  In that case, the plugin should confine itself to @file trees, or just vnodes in .leo files, for that matter.

7/1/04:

- Leo now writes "marks" and "expanded" attributes in the root &lt;v&gt; element for @thin trees.

- VERY IMPORTANT.  Leo now writes entire tree of @ignored @thin nodes.  This fixes a major bug.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040705111716.45">Leo marks as dirty all @file nodes when they become "newly unignored".</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040705112148"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20040705150130">Leo now generates no warnings with all significant tests enabled.  Some tests have been disabled in bases classes, and in a few cases pychecker gives erroneous warnings that have been suppressed directly in the source code using the __pychecker__ = arg syntax.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040713110718">Leo 4.2 beta 3           August 10, 2004

This version of Leo is feature complete.  Leo's core code has been stable for several months.

To do: most plugins work with the new code base, but other plugins need some more work.

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
derived files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts
that appear to use vnodes will still work because methods like c.currentVnode
that appear to return vnodes actually return positions.

- A new mod_scripting plugin is a big advance in scripting and testing.
test.leo now uses @test and @script nodes to define unit tests without
explicitly creating subclasses of unittest.TestCase. Converting scripts to unit
tests now takes a few seconds!

- A much faster and more robust spell checker plugin. (requires Python 2.3)

- Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of tabs.

- The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more clearly.

- The Perfect Import feature guarantee that Leo imports file exactly.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.16">Leo now vetoes the shutdown logic if saving a dirty file fails.

Leo prints in red the warning about not being able save the read-only file. The
user can use the Save To command to save the file. The Save To command does not
clear the file's dirty bit, so Leo will prompt again to save the file. The user
will have to ignore this prompt in order to exit. This is correct: the
_original_ file has not been saved.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.36">- g.getScript implicitly assumed that p == c.currentPosition.
  I removed that assumption.

- The scriptButton callback in the scripting.py plugin no longer calls c.executeScript.
  It's simpler and easier to call exec directly.

- Improved c.checkOutline:
    - Added full keyword arg.
    - Print more if verbose is on.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20040804164600.394">@nocolor

As a result, the minimal .leo file is:

&lt;find_panel_settings/&gt;
&lt;vnodes/&gt;
&lt;tnodes/&gt;
&lt;/leo_file&gt;

@nocolor

The empty_leo_file plugin now uses this code. The minimal .leo file that Leo
might actually write is more like this:

@color

These commands work on the selected Node and its descendants.  These commands ignore any nodes for which a) @ignore is in effect or b) @language python is in not effect.

The Check Python Code and Pretty Print Python Code commands replace nodes with their pretty-printed alternative.  No doubt everyone will have their own favorite style.  You could implement alternate pretty printers in a plugin merely by overriding the following methods of class prettyPrinter in leoCommands.py:
    
---- putOperator:      puts whitespace around operators.
---- putNormalToken:   puts whitespace around everything else.</t>

The shortcut definitions in Leo are quite inconvenient on the Mac, as those
using the Alt key don't work. Alt is used for entry of additional characters.
On the other hand, ctrl is available for shortcuts but not used in Leo, since
the ctrl-based shortcuts are shifted to the command key (following standard
Mac practice).

The patch at the end of this message simply shifts all Alt-shortcuts to Ctrl
on the Mac.

That leaves one minor clash: Command-` is used for CloneNode in Leo, although
it canonical MacOS function (switching between the windows of an application)
would be very useful in Leo as well. Removing the CloneNode binding is easy
enough, but it seems that I must implement a window switching function myself.
Not today :-)

The highlights of Leo 4.2:

- @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. Files derived from @thin can
be committed to cvs and updated from cvs without having to commit or update the
corresponding .leo file. There is no longer any need to keep .leo files and
derived files in synch.

- Leo's data structures have been reorganized. As a result, all outline
operations are much faster. To support this organization, scripts that traverse
Leo's data structures must now use a positions rather than vnodes. Old scripts

<t tx="ekr.20041226081019">c.spellCommands.openSpellTab()</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050122084954">Leo stores options in @settings trees, that is, parts of Leo outlines whose root node has the headline @settings.  When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees in the following places:

- The file called leoSettings.leo in the leo/config directory.
- The file called leoSettings.leo in the users home directory.
- The file being loaded.

Settings that later in the above list override settings found earlier. For example, any setting specified in an @settings tree in the file being loaded overrides any setting seen in any leoSettings.leo file.

The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces the body pane with a "settings dialog" pane. This settings dialog pane
allows you to change the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets.

The format of nodes in @settings trees are as follows:

1. "Simple settings nodes" have headlines of the form:

@&lt;type&gt; name = val

set the value of name to val, with the indicated type.

&lt;type&gt; may be one of the following, with valid values shown:

&lt;type&gt;          Valid values
-----           ------------
\@bool           True, False, 0, 1
\@color          A Tk color name or value, such as 'red' or 'xf2fddff' (without the quotes)

For a list of Tk color specifiers see:

- http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm
- http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkLib/GetColor.htm

\@directory      A path to a directory
\@float          A floating point number of the form nn.ff.
\@int            An integer
\@ints[list]     An integer (must be one of the ints in the list).
                 Example: @ints meaningOfLife[0,42,666]=42
\@path           A path to a directory or file
\@ratio          A floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.
\@string         A string
\@strings[list]  A string (must be one of the strings in the list).
                 Example: @strings tk_relief['flat','groove','raised']='groove'

2. "Complex settings nodes" have headlines of the form:

\@&lt;type&gt; description

The actual settings are specified in the body text.  At present, there are two such kinds of complex settings nodes:

- @font

The body text contains a list of settings for a font.  For example:

body_text_font_family = Courier New
body_text_font_size = None
body_text_font_slant = None
body_text_font_weight = None

- @recentFiles

The body text contains a list of paths of recently opened files, one path per line.

Warning: The following features of @recentfiles nodes are confusing and probably
will be changed:

- Leo does not save recent file information unless the open .leo file has an
@settings tree and an @recentfiles node within the @settings tree. That is, Leo
does not save recent files information in leoSettings.leo files.

- Changing the @rencentfiles node doesn't mark the Leo file as dirty, so if you
don't save the .leo file the recent files information will not be updated.

3.  All other nodes are "Organizer" nodes.  Such nodes have no effect on the settings shown in the dialog.  You may use them as you please to organize settings.

Notes:

A.  At present, you can not change @settings trees while executing the Settings command.  You can, however, change any @settings tree normally when not executing the Settings command.

B. Other kinds of settings nodes are planned for future releases.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050122090311">Leo 4.3 alpha 1                 January 24, 2005

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than four months of work. 

The defining features of Leo 4.3:

1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

4. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. You never have to mess with
pluginsManager.txt again! This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

5. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050122091036">The essential features of @settings trees and the settings dialog appear to be stable.  However, many improvements can be imagined, including the following:

- Allow searching for nodes while in the settings dialog.

- Allow adding, deleting, rearranging nodes while in the settings dialog.

- Allow adding, deleting, rearranging recent files while in the settings dialog.

These will be added as time permits and people request.</t>

This sets self.encoding temporarily. The actual value of self.encoding does not

- We must _not_ set self.encoding in scanHeader: that would interfere with
normal initialization.</t>

- Added many do-nothing methods to nullMenu class.

This should prevent the startup logic from messing with shortcuts in any way.  It's also the right thing to do.

- Added an entry for EqualSizedPanes to leoSettings.leo.  This overrides the default (Ctrl-E) and thereby prevents the default from overriding the entry for ExecuteScript!

- Re-enabled code in createMenuEntries that warns when shortcuts have been redefined.  Not sure if this is a wise idea, or indeed if it actually does anything :-)

I am tempted to remove all the default entries entirely.  This would simplify error reporting, but then Leo would hardly work at all if leoSettings.leo were not present.</t>

in the @+leo sentinel: there is no compiler in the world that tolerates mixed
comment delimiters.

BTW, the way to set javascript "inner" comments is to use @delims, not @comment.
N.B. The @language and @comment delimiters _will_ have an effect, and that
effect is in the _write_ logic, not the read logic. The effect is to set the
comment delims in the @+leo sentinel.

<t tx="ekr.20050123092834.565">Leo's code now contains an important simplification to Leo's gui code. This
arose because of a problem in the UNL plugin. The window that opened when double
clicking an @url UNL node wasn't staying on top.

It turns out that this was essentially impossible to fix with the old code. The
proximate cause of the original problem button-1 was bound to OnActivateTree,
which called g.app.gui.set_focus after the new window was visible, thereby
bringing the old tree to the front.

Further investigation revealed other problems. For example, the idle-time code
in the status line logic was also messing with the focus. It turns out that
repeatedly calling g.app.gui.set_focus is a very bad idea, for lots of reasons
which I won't go into in detail here.

The old code called g.app.gui.set_focus explicitly whenever it wanted focus to
change. But there is a much better way, namely to have routines that _indicate_
where they want the focus to be "after the dust settles", that is, when all gui
calls have been completed. I call this a "delayed focus" scheme.

So I rewrote all the code that sets the focus. The new code replaces direct
calls to g.app.gui.set_focus with calls to the following methods in
leoTkinterFrame class: bodyWantsFocus, statusLineWantsFocus, treeWantsFocus and
logWantsFocus. Actually, these xWantsFocus methods all do the same thing, but
using different methods improves traces.

This is an excellent pattern. Again, rather than setting the focus directly,
these xWantsFocus methods merely signal their intension to set the focus. This
allows very complex logic to be hidden in leoTkinterFrame.set_focus.

leoTkinterFrame.set_focus is indeed complex. It took me several hours this
morning to get it just right. It queues up a 'one-shot' callback. That is, at
most one copy of the callback is ever waiting to be executed. Furthermore, the
callback is only queued for execution at the result of a call to xWantsFocus; it
is never run automatically at idle time. Finally, even when executed, the
callback does nothing if the last requested commander (in the new ivar,
g.app.wantedFocus) does not match the commander to which the callback was bound.

These checks allow the UNL plugin to open a window properly and keep it topmost.

This is a big step forward for Leo, for the following reasons:

- Delayed focus ensures that the body pane always has focus unless the code has
a specific, positive reason for the focus to be elsewhere. This was difficult
(or rather impossible) to do with the old code: there are _many_ Tk calls that
can affect the focus.

- Delayed focus minimizes calls to g.app.gui.set_focus. Unlike the old code,
many seconds may elapse between calls. The stress on Tk is much less, and I
believe this may cure some flakiness in how focus changes, especially in
headlines.

- There are some cases where focus must change immediately. The xWantsFocus
methods all support a 'later' keyword argument. By default it is True, but when
it is False leoTkinterFrame.set_focus calls g.app.gui.set_focus immediately.

- The xWantsFocus methods all support a 'tag' keyword argument that tells what
routine the method is called from. It is a big help in making sense of traces.
BTW, extensive traces are the _only_ possible way of tracking down
focus/selection problems.</t>

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than four months of work. This alpha 2
release corrects various bugs and distribution problems.

a2 also adds several new features:

- Adds 'word', 'line' and 'node' undo granularities.

Symptom

Can not import messages were not being sent to the console, even though there is a call to es in g.cantImport.

What I did

- The code in g.es now checks for nullLog as well as log == None when deciding when to queue messages.

- g.openWithFileName now calls g.app.writeWaitingLog immediately after enabling the new log.

This writes the queued log messages in the proper order: a major advance in clarity.

about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from

I was pleasantly surprised to discover the reST2 plug-in working under 4.3a2
(this is one the first thing I try as I'd like to use Leo as an editor
for that).

As mentioned in early threads, it still needs @rst for each node to be included
in the reST rendering process. So I put @rst test.html and then a child with
@rst and some reST code and it worked !!

Then I tried to to get a simple rst file using @rst test but the plugin complained:

[snip]

  File "C:\dn_apps\Leo\plugins\rst2.py", line 164, in onIconDoubleClick
    writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c)
TypeError: writeTreeAsRst() takes exactly 5 arguments (4 given)

So I looked at the rst2.py and found a way to get it working but I would need
someone to verify it :

line 164, replaced   writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c)  by

syntax = False
writeTreeAsRst(rstFile,fname,p,c,syntax)

And it worked!

<t tx="ekr.20050225070247">This documents how I used Platypus 3.0 to create MacLeo, the MacOS X launcher
for Leo. You don't need Platypus to _use_ MacLeo, but you do need Platypus to
*create* MacLeo. You may download Platypus 3.0 from http://sveinbjorn.vefsyn.is/platypus
Platypus creates something called an "application bundle," essentially a wrapper
for the shell script called openLeoScript.sh.

At present this script contains just::

    #!/bin/sh
    # $2 only works if .leo is one of the extensions.
    /usr/bin/pythonw ~/leo/src/leo.py $2

In detail, here is how I created MacLeo:

1.  Open Platypus.

2.  Set the Platypus settings::

	- Name: MacLeo
	- Script type: shell
	- Icon: Python Icon
		- Using the standard Leo outline doesn't work, but one could be created…
	- Script Path: /Users/edream/dist/Platypus 3.0/openLeoScript.sh
	- Is droppable checkbox (checked)
		- Edit Types:  .leo only, not *, not folders.
		- N.B.  There MUST be a period in front of .leo!  Otherwise $2 will be empty in the script.
	- Output: None (progress bar and text window appear to be essentially useless)

3.  Hit the create button to create MacLeo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050225070247.1">This tells how I created ``leo-4-3-a3.pkg`` using ``PackageMaker``.

``PackageMaker`` is included in the ``Xtools`` disk that comes with MacOS X. Installing
``PackageMaker`` was easy, but I don't remember the details.

1.  Make sure ``~/dist/make-leo-dist`` contains a folder called ``leo-(version)``.
    The ``~/dist/make-leo-dist/leo-(version)`` folder should contain a *folder* called just ``leo``.
    This is the folder that should have the files to be distributed.
    I got this folder by downloading ``leo-4-3-a3.zip``, the official a3 distribution.

2.  Open ``PackageMaker`` by double-clicking the file ``~/dist/LeoPackage.pmsp``
    I originally created this .pmsp file in ``PackageMaker``.
    It will be included in the next official release.  I'll also add it to cvs.
    ``LeoPackage.pmsp`` contains most of the information needed to create the .pkg file,
    but even without the .pmsp file using ``PackageMaker`` is pretty self-explanatory

3.  Update the description in the ``PackageMaker`` dialog.
    This should be similar to the readme file.

4. Browse to ``~/dist/make-leo-dist/leo-(version)`` in the ``Files`` tab in the ``PackageMaker`` dialog.

5.  Choose ``Make Package`` from the ``PackageMaker File`` menu.
    If necessary, set the file name to ``Leo.pkg``.  This will create ``Leo.pkg``.

6.  Quit ``PackageMaker``.  Choose 'yes' when prompted to save ``LeoPackage.pmsp``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050306090601">Leo's .leo file format is extensible. The basis for extending .leo files are the
``t.unknownAttributes`` and ``v.unknownAttributes`` ivars of tnodes and vnodes,
or uA's for short. Leo translates between uA's and xml attributes in the
corresponding ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements in .leo files. Plugins may also use
``v.tempAttributes`` or ``t.tempAttributes`` ivars to hold temporary information
that will *not* be written to the .leo file.

Collectively, these four kinds of ivars are called **attribute ivars**.
Attribute ivars must be Python dictionaries, whose keys are names of plugins and
whose values are *other* dictionaries, called **inner dictionaries**, for
exclusive use of each plugin. For example, a plugin named 'xyzzy' would set
``t.unknownAttributes`` as follows::
    
    # Create the uA if necessary.
    if not hasattr(p.v.t,'unknownAttributes'):
        p.v.t.unknownAttributes = {}
    
    # Get the inner dictionary for the 'xyzzy' plugin, creating it if necessary.
    d = p.v.t.unknownAttributes.get('xyzzy',{})
    
    # Set some values. These values must be picklable.
    d ['duration'] = 5
    d ['notes'] = "This is a note."
    
    # Update the uA.
    p.v.t.unknownAttributes ['xyzzy'] = d
    
    if hasattr(p.v.t,"unknownAttributes"):
        d = p.v.t.unknownAttributes.get("xyzzy",{})
        g.es(d['duration'])
        g.es(d['notes'])

Plugins would use similar code to create ``v.unknownAttributes``,
``t.tempAttributes``, and ``v.tempAttributes`` ivars.

**Important**: All members of inner dictionaries should be picklable: Leo
uses Python's Pickle module to encode all values in these dictionaries. Leo will
discard any attributes that can not be pickled. This should not be a major
problem to plugins. For example, instead of putting a tnode into these
dictionaries, a plugin could put the tnode's gnx (a string) in the dictionary.

**Note**: Leo does *not* pickle members of inner dictionaries whose name (key) starts with ``str_``.
The values of such members should be a Python string.
This convention allows strings to appear in .leo files in a more readable format.

**Important**: Plugins must *not* use ``v.unknownAttributes`` inside ``@thin``
trees. Indeed Leo uses **hidden machinery** to write ``t.unknownAttributes``.
Leo does *not* write ``t.unknownAttributes`` to thin derived files. Instead Leo
writes a representation of all ``t.unknownAttributes`` contained in the
``@thin`` tree to a special xml attribute called
``descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes`` in the ``&lt;v&gt;`` element corresponding to the
``@thin`` node. Yes, this is complicated, but it works. Leo can *not* write
``v.unknownAttributes`` in ``@thin`` trees because **only tnodes have gnx's in
thin derived files**. In effect, vnodes are anonymous.

Plugins that must associate attributes with vnodes should support only ``@file``
trees. A completely different alternative would be for the plugin to extend how
Leo reads and writes ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements in .leo files, but that would be much more
complicated than using ``t.unknownAttributes``

Here are the details about how Leo associates uA's with ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements in .leo files:

- **Native xml attributes** are the attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements that are
  known (treated specially) by Leo's read/write code.
  The only native attribute of ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements is ``tx``.
  The native attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements are ``a``, ``t``, ``vtag``, ``tnodeList``,
  ``marks``, ``expanded`` and ``descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes``.
  All other attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` and ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements are **foreign xml attributes**.

- When reading a .leo file, Leo will create ``t.unknownAttributes`` or ``v.unknownAttributes`` ivars for
  any ``tnode`` or ``vnode`` whose corresponding ``&lt;v&gt;`` or ``&lt;t&gt;`` element contains a foreign xml attribute.
 
- When writing a file, Leo will write foreign xml attributes in ``&lt;v&gt;`` or ``&lt;t&gt;`` elements
  if the corresponding  vnode or tnode contains an ``unknownAttributes`` ivar.

- Leo performs the usual xml escapes on these strings when reading or writing the ``unknownAttributes`` ivars.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050313101229">Leo 4.3 alpha 4                 March 15, 2005

Leo 4.3 is the culmination of more than five months of work. This alpha 4
focuses on plugins: all known plugins are now in leoPlugins.leo. Most plugins
now work with the 4.3 code base. Warning: not all plugins have been tested
thorougly.

This alpha 4 release also adds the requently-requested Add Comments and Delete
Comments commands to Leo's Edit Body menu.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:

1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

4. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. You never have to mess with
pluginsManager.txt again! This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

5. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail. Leo is distributed with Pmw (Python Mega Widgets), path.py and
sets.py in this directory.</t>

to remember whether to get the commander using keywords.get('c') or
keywords.get('new_c') or both. This was needlessly confusing.

All hooks that use the 'new_c' key now use also include the 'c' key. The 'new_c'
key is deprectated; plugins should use the 'c' key instead. 

None of the plugins presently in leoPlugins.leo use the 'new_c' key, but the
'new_c' key still exists for compatibility.

describe the operation that is being performed. **Note**: ``u`` is shorthand for
``c.undoer``. Most ``u.beforeX`` methods return ``undoData`` that the client
code merely passes to the corresponding ``u.afterX`` method. This data contains
the 'before' snapshot. The ``u.afterX`` methods then create a bead containing
both the 'before' and 'after' snapshots.

``u.beforeChangeGroup`` and ``u.afterChangeGroup`` allow multiple calls to
``u.beforeX`` and ``u.afterX`` methods to be treated as a single undoable entry.
See the code for the ``Change All``, ``Sort``, ``Promote`` and ``Demote``
commands for examples. The ``u.beforeChangeGroup`` and ``u.afterChangeGroup``
methods substantially reduce the number of ``u.beforeX`` and ``afterX`` methods
needed.

Plugins and scripts may define their own ``u.beforeX`` and ``afterX`` methods. Indeed,
``u.afterX`` merely needs to set the ``bunch.undoHelper`` and
``bunch.redoHelper`` ivars to the methods used to undo and redo the operation.
See the code for the various ``u.beforeX`` and ``afterX`` methods for guidance.

``p.setDirty`` and ``p.setAllAncestorAtFileNodesDirty`` now return a
``dirtyVnodeList`` that all vnodes that became dirty as the result of an
operation. More than one list may be generated: client code is responsible for
merging lists using the pattern ``dirtyVnodeList.extend(dirtyVnodeList2)``

See the section ``&lt;&lt; How Leo implements unlimited undo &gt;&gt;`` in ``leoUndo.py``
for more details. In general, the best way to see how to implement undo is to
see how Leo's core calls the ``u.beforeX`` and ``afterX`` methods.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.3">The initial bug report:

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3048149

The problem arose from a misguided attempt to eliminate non-useful information
from traces. Alas, the baby got thrown out with the bath water.

Here are the changes I made:

 - c.executeScript now calls g.es_exception(full=True) to ensure that a full
 stack trace always gets produced. This is especially important when the
 exception happens in a module (file) called by the script.

- c.executeScript now always executes the section &lt; &lt; dump the lines near the
error &gt; &gt;, regardless of context. The lines are printed (in black) in the log.
This is useful information in almost all cases.

- After much experimentation, g.es_exception is basically unchanged. Note: If
the error occurs in your script itself (as contrasted with an exception thrown
from a file called by your script) Leo always has properly put the cursor on the
offending line. I made no changes in this logic.

BTW, calling pdb.set_trace() in your scripts may cause more problems than it is
worth. Indeed.pdb.set_trace() uses only the information on the stack, and that
may not be enough information to be useful. I usually use g.trace to find out
what is happening. This works well.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.22">Initial bug report:

http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3053699

There were three similar bugs, all arising from the fact that g.os_path_abs and
g.os_path_join return the _working_ directory if the initial path is None!

I removed my HOME directory for testing. This was essential.

- Compute home directory must return None, rather than the working directory if
the HOME variable is None.

- app.setLeoId must be careful (in two sections) to do nothing if any of
(homeDir,globalConfigDir,loadDir) is None.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.131">- Moved computeGlobalConfigDir, computeHomeDir, computeLoadDir and startupEncoding from leo.py to leoGlobals.py.

- Created g.computeStandardDirectories and used it in leo.py.

- Created g.createStandAloneApp using the above functions.  This function was based on the 'Standalone Operation' classed in the plugin_manager plugin.  g.createStandAloneApp doesn't actually use any of these classes because the nullGui class is basically a clumsier version of the BlackHole class.

- Added a do-nothing attachLeoIcon method to nullGui class to suppress a warning.  As I said, the nullGui class is not as elegant as Paul's BlackHole class.

- Added &lt;&lt;importLeoGlobals&gt;&gt; button to newButtons plugin.  This creates a node named
  &lt;&lt; define importLeoGlobals &gt;&gt; whose body text defines an importLeoGlobals function.

The idea is that importing leoGlobals from a stand-alone plugin is a bit tricky.  The importLeoGlobals handles these details.  Note that we don't want to define importLeoGlobals in a node included by @others, because this function must be available to the code in the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section.  So we use a named section and reference it in before referencing the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section.  See the plugin_manager plugin for an example.

- Changed the plugin_manager plugin as follows:
    - Used the newButtons plugin to add an &lt;&lt; define importLeoGlobals &gt;&gt; section.
    - Simplified the import logic using importLeoGlobals function.
    - Commented out the Standalone Operation classes.

    self.outputFile.write(s)

<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.316">The only changes concern how Leo encodes and decodes items in
t.unknownAttributes and v.unknownAttributes.

Without changing the file format, the only way to tell Leo how to write
attributes is to use naming conventions. When writing attributes, Leo now does
the following:

- Do nothing except apply xml escapes if the attribute name (in
t.unknownAttributes or v.unknownAttributes) starts with str_ and the attribute
is, in fact, a string. If the string is a Unicode string Leo converts the
Unicode string to an encoded string.

- Use the present pickling/hexlifying scheming otherwise. In particular, issue a
warning and ignore the attribute if the attribute can not be pickled. BTW, there
is no need for separate base64 support: hexlifying guarantees that the result is
valid in any xml environment.

Leo now does the reverse when reading.

BTW, plugins could add their own naming conventions in an emergency. Indeed, the
conventions will be confined to code in atFile.putUa and atFile.getUa, so a
plugin would only need to override these two methods.</t>

1. Leo stores recent files info in files called .leoRecentFiles.txt. These will
be a plain text files with one line per recent files entry. An Easter egg: if
the file starts with read-only, read_only, readonly, etc. Leo will never update
the file and will not remember changes to the Recent Files menu.

2. On startup, Leo searches for the .leoRecentFiles.txt files in the user's home
directory, if it exists. Leo looks in Leo's config directory next, but only if
the home directory does not exist, or does not contain a .leoRecentFiles.txt
file. In other words, Leo will use at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file on
startup.

3. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for .leoRecentFiles.txt in the directory
containing the file.

4. At no time after installation does Leo create any .leoRecentFiles.txt file.
This will allow users (or their managers) to set policy regarding where to store
this information (if anywhere).

5. Leo writes at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file when saving a .leo file,
namely the file read in item 3 if it exists, or the file read in item 2
otherwise.

This is a flexible scheme that should meet most needs without having to resolve
thorny questions about exactly where recent files info belongs.</t>

- Properly implemented undo/redo Clear Recent Files.

- readSettingsFiles now reads @recentfiles nodes from all settings files.

- Created @settings nodes and @recent-files nodes if they do not exist.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050429094215.355">@killcolor

You all have convinced me that storing recent files data in .leo files is a dubious idea. My new plan is as follows:

1. Leo will store recent files info in files called .leoRecentFiles.txt.  These will be a plain text files with one line per recent files entry.  These will be local files, so problems concerning directory structure and path specifications should go away.

2.  On startup, Leo will search for the .leoRecentFiles.txt files in the user's home directory, if it exists.  Leo will look in Leo's config directory next, but only if the home directory does not exist, or does not contain a .leoRecentFiles.txt file.  In other words, Leo will use at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file on startup.

3.  When opening a .leo file, Leo will look for .leoRecentFiles.txt in the directory containing the file.

4.  At no time after installation will Leo create any .leoRecentFiles.txt file.  This will allow users (or their managers) to set policy regarding where to store this information (if anywhere).

5.  Leo will write at most one .leoRecentFiles.txt file when saving a .leo file, namely the file read in item 3 if it exists, or the file read in item 2 otherwise.

6.  Leo will have settings to tell which .leoRecentFiles.txt files may be written.

7. Leo will never create @settings nodes or @recent-files nodes automatically.  Moreover, I shall remove the @recent-files panel from the settings dialog and the corresponding @recent-files code from the config classes.

I believe this will address everyone's concerns without the need for resolving thorny questions about exactly where recent files info belongs.

<t tx="ekr.20050513141852">Leo 4.3 beta 2                 May 15, 2005

Leo 4.3 beta 2 completes all major features of Leo 4.3 and fixes all bugs
reported since the beta 1 release.

The defining features of Leo 4.3:
---------------------------------
1. Leo now stores options in @settings trees, that is, outlines whose headline
is '@settings'. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks for @settings trees not only
in the outline being opened but also in various leoSettings.leo files.

The key design goal of @settings trees was that Leo's user options must be
infinitely flexible. That goal has been accomplished. Indeed, users can create
arbitrarily complex user options with @settings trees. Leo settings outlines
are, in fact, infinitely more flexible and powerful than any scheme based on
flat text.  Readers of Python's configParser shootout take note!

2. The Settings command temporarily replaces the outline pane with an outline
showing all the @settings trees in effect. The Settings command also replaces
the body pane with a "settings pane". This settings pane allows you to change
the settings selected in the outline pane using standard gui widgets. The
settings pane is dynamically created from nodes in the settings tree; it is as
extensible as the @settings tree itself.

3. Leo now stores recent files information in .leoRecentFiles.txt files.

4. Leo's read/write code in leoAtFile.py has been rewritten to support user-
defined tangling and untangling.  This is a major cleanup of Leo's core.

5. Leo now boasts a wonderful new Plugins Manager plugin. This plugin enables
and disables plugins automatically. You never have to mess with
pluginsManager.txt again! This plugin also tells you everything you need to know
about each plugin. Finally, this plugin also lets you download plugins from
Leo's cvs site! Many thanks to Paul Patterson for this excellent work.

6. You can install third-party extensions in Leo's extensions directory. Leo
will attempt to import such extensions from the extensions directory if normal
imports fail. Leo is distributed with Pmw (Python Mega Widgets), path.py and
sets.py in this directory.</t>

The nav_buttons plugin was using self.c rather than keywords.get('c') in a hook
handler. The general rule is that hook handlers should do nothing if self.c !-
keywords.get('c').  This was an old bug, arising from the rewrite of the plugin.

I added a warning to that effect in the plugin template.

It would perhaps be better to specify an optional commander in registerHandler
and only call the handler if the commander matches. However, this isn't so easy
or clean to do.I

The plugin was failing to set the positionList ivar (in the base
tkinterListBoxDialog class). This was a fairly recent blunder: I saw that
positionList wasn't used in the plugin directly, so I 'improved' the code by
using a local var instead of self.positionList. This illustrates a hazard of
using subclassing.</t>

    - Added forcePythonSentinels arg (default is True).
    - g.getScript no longer temporarily alters any body text.
        - atFile.writeFromString gets the initial text using the fromString arg.
    - g.getScript now always calls atFile.writeFromString to handle all Leo directives.

- Added forcePythonSentinels to atFile.initWriteIvars and atFile.scanAllDirectives.
    - Default is None, in which case the code sets forcePythonSentinels to the scriptWrite arg.

- Added forcePythonSentinels to atFile.scanAllDirectives.
    - Default is False.

- Created atFile.putAtFirstLines and atFile.putAtLastLines.
    - These replace the corresonding sections in writeOpenFile.
    - It was not actually necessary to define these, but it cleans up the code.

    - This handles all the details of simulating a write _from_ a string _to_ a string.

- atFile.initWriteIvars and atFile.openFileForWriting now allow root to be None.

By: rogererens

I swear I didn't wait for the release to be the first to report a bug! I just
didn't try this in the alfa/beta versions:

Leo 4.3 final, build  1.262 , May 23, 2005
Python 2.4.1, Tk 8.4.7, win32

Changing
Global settings: C:\Leo\config\leoSettings.leo--&gt;Window options--&gt;@page Options
for new windows--&gt;@ratio initial_horizontal_ratio = 0.3
or any of the other ratios, does not save them to leoSettings.leo. So after
restarting I still have the old settings in use.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.6">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3167166

The fix was to add the following line to the init function:

    global click_registry, coloured_nodes</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.8">Modifying outlines can invalidate existing positions!  This rarely happens.  At present it affects the atFile.read logic when reading an outline whose initial current position is a clone outside an @thin tree with another clone inside the @thin tree.  So the read logic computes the expected current position before reading all derived files, and this expected current position becomes invalid.

What I did:

1.  Moved &lt;&lt; set current and top positions &gt;&gt; from getVnodes to end of getLeoFile.
This ensures that the outline won't change after computing the position.

2. Unit tests will have to be revised to make sure that only valid positions get used.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050620144052.48">- Fixed bugs in convertAllBlanks and convertAllTabs.

These must always call afterChangeGroup to match beforeChangeGroup, even if
nothing has changed.

- Added u.getMark and u.rollbackToMark.

These allow unit tests to cut the undo stack back to an initial position in the
tearDown method. This should be done for all tests that use u.undo and u.redo
methods. The bug was probably the result of changing the outline in the tearDown
method.

Both the Reformat Paragraph and Edit Body unit tests now roll back the undo stack.

- Added traces for unexpected conditions in u.undo, u.redo and tree.select.

- Call u.setUndoTypes() in u.setUndoTypingParams when returning early.

- Corrected Edit Body unit tests.

These tests should not call undo/redo when nothing is expected to change. Doing
so may trigger the new 'cant undo' traces in u.undo.

- doTest in leoTest.py now makes copies of both p and p1.

It's not clear that this is needed, it can't hurt, and it may have been important.</t>

colored words?

<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.3">The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText_ (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text
formatting markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any
text).

.. The line @rst &lt;xyzzy&gt; causes problems.

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The Write
Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for **rst root nodes**
whose headline have the form @rst xyzzy. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

.. .. [1] See footnote 1.

.. .. [2] See footnote 2.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils_ module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity_ syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.
.. .. See `Required cascading style sheets`_ for more details.
See Required cascading style sheets for more details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.4">The rst3 plugin provides several important benefits compared to previous rst plugins:

1. This plugin allows much more flexible control over its operations using **rst3 options**. You can
set options in @settings trees, in headlines and in body text. Nodes inherit most rst3 options from
ancestor nodes much like nodes inherit Leo directives.  See `Options`_.

The most important option is the code_mode option. This option specifies whether to process the
body text of a node as rst markup (rst mode) or source code that is to be converted to rST
markup (code mode). Unlike previous versions of this plugin, any node can be processed in any
mode.

2. Headlines can set any option. This turns out to be very convenient. See `Headline commands`_ for
details.  Nodes whose headlines start with @rst-options are treated specially. The body text of such **rst
options nodes** should contain nothing but lines of the form::

    &lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

3. You can set any rst3 options in the *body text* of any node
using doc parts of the form::

    @ @rst-options
    list of rst3 options, one per line
    @c

Such **option doc parts** allows you to specify rst3 options even with source code files.

4. You can embed rST markup in the body text
of any node using doc parts of the form::

    @ @rst-markup
    any rST markup
    @c

Such **markup doc parts** allow you to fine-tune the formatting of your source files.
See `Using doc parts`_ for full details.

All these features create a wonderful environment for using rST.
There is complete integration of Leo outlines with rST markup.
You can embed both rst3 options and rST markup in any node, even node in derived files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.5">You can set any option in any node, so you have complete control over how this plugin processes each
node.  The following is a list of options that control how the rst3 plugin formats each particular node.

code_mode
    True: process nodes in code mode.  False: process nodes in rst mode.
    In code mode, the rst3 plugin automatically creates rST markup to display the body text as an
    rst code-block. In rst mode the rst3 simply copies the body text of the node to the output. That
    is, the plugin assumes that body text is already valid rST markup.

default_path
    The path to be prepended to filenames given in root nodes.  The default is an empty string.
    
generate_rst
    A master switch.
    True: generate rST markup for rST sections and rST code-blocks.
    False: don't generate rST markup and ignore @ @rst-markup doc parts.

number_code_lines
    Controls whether to number code lines in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs
    True: Move doc parts outside of the code-block directive in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

    **Cool**: Any rST markup in doc parts included as the result of this option will be rendered properly.

show_headlines
    True: automatically generate rST sections from headlines.
    Applies to both code mode and rst mode.

    The level of the node in the outline determines the level of the section
    underling in the rST markup. Higher-level headlines in the outline
    correspond to higher-level section headings; lower-level headlines in the
    outline correspond to lower-level section headings.

show_leo_directives
    True: include Leo directives in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_markup_doc_parts
    True: include markup doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_doc_parts
    True: include options doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_nodes
    True: show @rst-options nodes.

show_organizer_nodes
    True: generate rST sections for nodes that do not contain body text.
    This option has no effect unless the rST section would otherwise be written.

stylesheet_name
    The name of the stylesheet passed to docutils.  The default is 'default.css'

stylesheet_path
    The directory containing the stylesheet passed to docutils.  The default is an empty string.

underline_characters
    The underlining characters to be used to specify rST sections.  
    The default value is \'\'\'#=+*^~"'\`-:&gt;&lt;\_\'\'\'.
    The first character is reserved so you can specify the top-level section explicitly.

verbose
    True: write informational messages.

write_intermediate_file
    True: writes intermediate files before sending them to docutils.
    This option only applies to .htm, .html and .tex files.
    The name of the intermediate file has the name of the output file with .txt appended.
    This option has effect only if the generate_rst option is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.6">It is often convenient to set options in headlines.  This is done with the following **headline commands**:

.. changed &lt;text&gt; to TEXT to avoid problems.

@rst TEXT
    Enter rst mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-code TEXT
    Enter code mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-ignore-node TEXT
    Suppress all output from a single node. TEXT is ignored.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-ignore-tree TEXT
    Suppress all output from the node and its descendants.  TEXT is ignored.
    Does **not** change any rst3 formatting option.

@rst-no-head TEXT
    Suppress the generation of an rST section for this node only.  Does not affect descendant nodes.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-no-headlines TEXT
    Set the show_headlines option to False.  As a result, TEXT is ignored.

@rst-option OPTION = VALUE
    Set a single option to the given value.  The default value is True.

@rst-options TEXT
    Set zero or more options from the body text of the node.  TEXT is ignored.
    The entire body text is treated as if it were in an @ @rst-options doc part.

**Notes**:

- Several of these commands affect only the node in which they appear.  Such commands set internal settings variables only: they have no effect on the visible rst3 options.

- If a headline generates an rST section, the section name does not include the headline command.  Furthermore, no rST section is generated if the TEXT is empty.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.7">Recall that in Leo a doc part starts with the '@' directive and continues until the end of body text or until the '@c' directive is seen.  For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

Leo converts doc parts into comments using whatever comment delimiters are in effect.

**Option doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-options. All other
lines of such doc parts should be of the form name=value. (rST comments lines
starting with '..' are allowed). For example::

    @ @rst-options
    .. This comment line is ignored.
    show_headlines=False
    show_leo_directives=False
    verbose=True
    @c

The rst3 plugin sets options from option doc parts, even in code mode.

**Markup doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-markup.  For example::

    @ @rst-markup
    .. contents::

The rst3 plugin replaces markup doc parts by the markup they contain, even in code mode.

Option and markup doc parts are especially useful in code mode. They allow you
to specify options or insert rST markup directly from with derived files. This
makes your source files self contained: there is no need to add other nodes to
make the rst3 plugin happy.

A cool feature: In code mode, rST markup in *ordinary* doc parts will be
rendered properly when the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option is in effect.
*Important*: Regardless of the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option, doc parts
have no special significance in rst mode. That is, the entire `doc part` from
the opening '@' to the closing '@c and everything in between are treated normal
rST markup.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.9">You can set the defaults for any rst3 option in several ways:

\1.  By setting options in the root node using @ @rst-options doc parts.
For example, the root of the file that generated this documentation contains::

    @ @rst-options
    code_mode=False
    generate_rst=True
    show_organizer_nodes=True
    show_headlines=True
    show_leo_directives=True
    verbose=True
    @c

\2. By setting options in @settings trees.  To do this, you must prefix the option name shown in this documentation with the prefix 'rst3\_'.  For example::

    @settings
        @bool rst3_write_intermediate_file = True
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.10">This plugin defines a code-block rST directive.  The primary purpose of this directive is to show formatted source code.

In rst mode you can insert the code-block directive like any other rST markup.  The rst3 plugin generates code-block directives when handling nodes in code mode.

This directive takes one argument, a language name.  Like this::

    .. code-block:: Python

        import leoPlugins
        import leoGlobals as g

This directive syntax colors the code in the indented code block that follows the directive.
The result looks like this if the SilverCity syntax coloring module has been installed.

.. code-block:: Python
    
    import leoPlugins
    import leoGlobals as g

Otherwise, the output looks like this::

    import leoPlugins
    import leoGlobals as g

See the tree called "Scripting chapter using the rst plugin" in LeoDocs.leo for many examples of how to use code-blocks.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.11">HTML files generated by the rst3 plugin assume that three .css (cascading style sheet) files exist
in the same directory. For the HTML output to look good the following .css
files should exist:

- default.css is the default style sheet that docutils expects to exist.

- leo_rst.css contains some style improvements based on Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory.

- silver_city.css is the style sheet that controls the syntax highlighting generated by SilverCity.

The latter two style sheets are imported at the end of the default.css.

**Important:** You can use cascading style sheets to do things that otherwise
wouldn't be possible with "plain" rST. For instance, the background color of
this page was specified in a body style.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.12">The plugin reserves the '#' character for your own use so that you can
specify an rST headline explicitly. For example,::

    #####
    Title
    #####

You would typically put such a title in the rst root node. Otherwise, you should
let the rst3 plugin automatically generate rST sections from headlines.

To create a table of contents (TOC) put::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents

on its own line wherever you want the TOC to appear.  This line can appear in body text in rst mode,
or in an @ @rst-markup doc part in code mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.13"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.14">The file ListManagerDocs.html_ is an impressive example of the kind of output
that can be generated relatively easily using this plugin.

The source for ListManagerDocs.html is wxListManager.leo_.
**Important**: wxListManager.leo was written for the rst2 plugin; it
could be greatly simplified if adapted for the rst3 plugin.

The files in LeoDocs.leo under the node 'Leo's HTML Users Guide' contain
examples of using the rst3 plugin.

This documentation was created using the rst3 plugin. The source code for this
documentation is in LeoDocs.leo. The source code for all the rst plugins is in
LeoPlugins.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.15">Josef Dalcolmo wrote the initial rst plugin.  Timo Honkasalo, Bernhard Mulder, Paul Paterson, Kent Tenney and Steve Zatz made contributions to the rst and rst2 plugins.  Edward K. Ream designed and wrote the rst3 plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050813102008.16">-------------

|leo|</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050814093016">The following options are for the use of Bernhard Mulder's http plugin.  The http plugin creates an http server running on a local port, typically 8080.  When the http plugin is running you will see a purple message in the log window that looks something like this::

    http serving enabled on port 8080, version 0.91

To use the http plugin, start a web browser and enter this url::

    http://localhost:8080/

You will see a a top level page containing one link for every open .leo file.  Clicking on link will cause the http server to pass a new page to the browser.  You can use the browser's refresh button to update the top-level view in the browser after you have opened or closed files.

**Important**: See the docstring for the http plugin for information on configuring the plugin.
Some of the following rst3 settings must match values of settings for the http plugin. 
Here are the rst3 options that support the http plugin:

http_server_support
    A master switch: none of the following options have any effect unless this option is True.
    If True, the rst3 plugin does the following:

    - Writes **node markers** in the rst output for use by the http plugin. Node markers are rst named hyperlink targets.  By default they look like::
    
            .. _http-node-marker-N
    
      where N is a unique node number.

    - Adds additional information to all nodes of the tree being formatted using Leo's
      unknownAttributes mechanism.

http_attributename
    The name of the attribute name written to the unknownAttributes attribute of
    each each outline node in the rst root tree.
    The default is 'rst_http_attribute';
    it should match the following setting of the *http* plugin::

        @string rst_http_attributename = 'rst_http_attribute'
    
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

clear_http_attributes
    If True the rst3 plugin initially clears the fields specified by `http_attributename`.  
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

node_begin_marker
    The string used for node markers. The default is 'http-node-marker-'.
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050814144727">The code for the rst3 plugin is more complex than usual.  Fortunately, the overall organization is straightforward.

defaultOptionsDict
    This dictionary represents each rst3 option.
    To add another option, just add another entry to this dictionary.
    Keys are the option name, including the `rst3_` prefix.
    Values are the default value of the option.
    The hard values in the dictionary may be changed as the result of @settings entries.

processTree
    processTree is the top-level code that handles one rst root node.
    It calls preprocessTree to create the **tnodeOptionDict** ivar.
    processTree then calls either writeNormalTree or writeSpecialTree
    depending on whether text will be sent to docutils for further processing.
    These two methods handle mundane details of opening an closing files.
    Both writeNormalTree and writeSpecialTree call **writeTree** to do the actual work.

tnodeOptionDict
    The entries in this dictionary represents the options that are set in one particular node.
    The keys of tnodeOptionDict are tnodes, the values are anonymous dictionaries.
    These anonymous inner dictionaries contain the options that are explicitly set at each tnode
    (and thus each position).
    Preprocessing the tree this way ensures that each node (headline and body text) is parsed exactly once.

writeTree
    writeTree first calls **scanAllOptions**, which has the effect of
    initializing all options. writeTree then calls **writeNode** for each node
    that will be processed by the rst3 plugin. Options may cause the plugin to
    skip a node or an entire subtree.

writeNode
    writeNode first calls **scanAllOptions** to compute the options that are in
    effect for that *single* node. Once options have computed, processing the
    node is straightforward. writeNode calls writeBody and writeHeadline
    to do the real work. These methods generate or skip text based on various
    options.

scanAllOptions
    scanAllOptions recreates the optionsDict ivar to represent *all* the options
    in effect for *for the particular node being processed by writeNode*. Client
    code gets these options by calling the getOption method.

    scanAllOptions first inits all options from settings,
    then updates those options using the anonymous
    dictionaries contained in the tnodeOptionsDict.
    scanAllOptions works like g.scanAllDirectives, but the code is much simpler.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050816051911">The following options specify the 'spelling' of headline commands.  The option_prefix and option_prefixes command also define the spelling of special doc parts.

You can change these to make them shorter or to avoid conflicts with headlines in your Leo files.  The list below merely gives the default value for each setting.

.. escape the '@' signs so they don't become email addresses.

`code_prefix`: '\@rst-code'

`ignore_headline_prefix`: '\@rst-no-head'

`ignore_headlines_prefix`: '\@rst-no-headlines'

<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.2">The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText_ (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text
formatting markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any
text).

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The Write
Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for **rst root nodes**
whose headline have the form @rst &lt;filename&gt;. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils_ module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity_ syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.
See `Required cascading style sheets`_ for more details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.3">The rst3 plugin provides several important benefits compared to previous rst plugins:

1. This plugin allows much more flexible control over its operations using **rst3 options**. You can
set options in @settings trees, in headlines and in body text. Nodes inherit most rst3 options from
ancestor nodes much like nodes inherit Leo directives.  See `Options`_.

The most important option is the code_mode option. This option specifies whether to process the
body text of a node as rst markup (rst mode) or source code that is to be converted to rST
markup (code mode). Unlike previous versions of this plugin, any node can be processed in any
mode.

2. Headlines can set any option. This turns out to be very convenient. See `Headline commands`_ for
details.  Nodes whose headlines start with @rst-options are treated specially. The body text of such **rst
options nodes** should contain nothing but lines of the form::

    &lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

3. You can set any rst3 options in the *body text* of any node
using doc parts of the form::

    @ @rst-options
    list of rst3 options, one per line
    @c

Such **option doc parts** allows you to specify rst3 options even with source code files.

4. You can embed rST markup in the body text
of any node using doc parts of the form::

    @ @rst-markup
    any rST markup
    @c

Such **markup doc parts** allow you to fine-tune the formatting of your source files.
See `Using doc parts`_ for full details.

All these features create a wonderful environment for using rST.
There is complete integration of Leo outlines with rST markup.
You can embed both rst3 options and rST markup in any node, even node in derived files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.4">You can set any option in any node, so you have complete control over how this plugin processes each
node.  The following is a list of options that control how the rst3 plugin formats each particular node.

code_mode (default: False)
    True: process nodes in code mode.  False: process nodes in rst mode.
    In code mode, the rst3 plugin automatically creates rST markup to display the body text as an
    rst code-block. In rst mode the rst3 simply copies the body text of the node to the output. That
    is, the plugin assumes that body text is already valid rST markup.
    
doc_only_mode (default: False)
    True: process nodes in doc_only mode.
    False: process nodes in rst mode or code_mode, depending on options.
    In doc_only mode, the rst3 plugin outputs only regular doc parts and @ @rst-markup doc parts.
    Headlines create section in doc_only mode only if
    a\) the node contains a doc part or b\) the show_organizer_nodes option is in effect.
    As always can use @ @rst-options for per-node control of the process,
    especially node-by-node control of the show_organizer_nodes option.

default_path (default: '')
    The path to be prepended to filenames given in root nodes.
    
generate_rst (default: True)
    A master switch.
    True: generate rST markup for rST sections and rST code-blocks.
    False: don't generate rST markup and ignore @ @rst-markup doc parts.

number_code_lines (default: True)
    Controls whether to number code lines in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs (default: False)
    True: Move doc parts outside of the code-block directive in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.
    **Cool**: Any rST markup in doc parts included as the result of this option will be rendered properly.

show_headlines (default: True)
    True: automatically generate rST sections from headlines.
    Applies to both code mode and rst mode.
    The level of the node in the outline determines the level of the section
    underling in the rST markup. Higher-level headlines in the outline
    correspond to higher-level section headings; lower-level headlines in the
    outline correspond to lower-level section headings.

show_leo_directives (default: True)
    True: include Leo directives in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_markup_doc_parts (default: False)
    True: include markup doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_doc_parts (default: False)
    True: include options doc parts in code mode.
    This option has no effect in rst mode.

show_options_nodes (default: False)
    True: show @rst-options nodes.

show_organizer_nodes (default: True)
    True: generate rST sections for nodes that do not contain body text.
    This option has no effect unless the rST section would otherwise be written.
    
strip_at_file_prefixes (default: True)
    True: remove @auto, @file, @nosent and @thin from the start of headlines.

stylesheet_name (default: 'default.css')
    The name of the stylesheet passed to docutils.

stylesheet_path (default: '')
    The directory containing the stylesheet passed to docutils.

underline_characters (default: \'\'\'#=+*^~"'\`-:&gt;&lt;\_\'\'\')
    The underlining characters to be used to specify rST sections.
    The first character is reserved so you can specify the top-level section explicitly.

verbose (default: True)
    True: write informational messages.

write_intermediate_file (default: False)
    True: writes intermediate files before sending them to docutils.
    This option only applies to .htm, .html and .tex files.
    The name of the intermediate file has the name of the output file with .txt appended.
    This option has effect only if the generate_rst option is True.
    
publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets (Default: '')
    The arguments to be passed to docutils.core.Publisher().publish()
    when no stylesheet is in effect.
    This is a string that represents a comma-separated list of strings:
    For example, the option::

        publish-argv-for-missing-stylesheets=--language=de,--documentclass=report,--use-latex-toc
        
    results in the call::
        
        publish(['--language=de','--documentclass=report','--use-latex-toc'])
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.5">The following options are for the use of Bernhard Mulder's http plugin.  The http plugin creates an http server running on a local port, typically 8080.  When the http plugin is running you will see a purple message in the log window that looks something like this::

    http serving enabled on port 8080, version 0.91

To use the http plugin, start a web browser and enter this url::

    http://localhost:8080/

You will see a a top level page containing one link for every open .leo file.  Clicking on link will cause the http server to pass a new page to the browser.  You can use the browser's refresh button to update the top-level view in the browser after you have opened or closed files.

**Important**: See the docstring for the http plugin for information on configuring the plugin.
Some of the following rst3 settings must match values of settings for the http plugin. 
Here are the rst3 options that support the http plugin:

http_server_support (default: False)
    A master switch: none of the following options have any effect unless this option is True.
    If True, the rst3 plugin does the following:

    - Writes **node markers** in the rst output for use by the http plugin. Node markers are rst named hyperlink targets.  By default they look like::
    
            .. _http-node-marker-N
    
      where N is a unique node number.

    - Adds additional information to all nodes of the tree being formatted using Leo's
      unknownAttributes mechanism.

http_attributename (default: 'rst_http_attribute')
    The name of the attribute name written to the unknownAttributes attribute of
    each each outline node in the rst root tree.
    The default is 'rst_http_attribute';
    it should match the following setting of the *http* plugin::

        @string rst_http_attributename = 'rst_http_attribute'
    
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

clear_http_attributes (default: False)
    If True the rst3 plugin initially clears the fields specified by `http_attributename`.  
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.

node_begin_marker (default: 'http-node-marker-')
    The string used for node markers.
    This option has no effect unless the http_server_support option is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.6">The following options specify the 'spelling' of headline commands.  The option_prefix and option_prefixes command also define the spelling of special doc parts.

You can change these to make them shorter or to avoid conflicts with headlines in your Leo files.  The list below merely gives the default value for each setting.

`code_prefix`: '\@rst-code'

`ignore_headline_prefix`: '\@rst-no-head'

`ignore_headlines_prefix`: '\@rst-no-headlines'

`ignore_prefix_tree`: '\@rst-ignore'

`ignore_node_prefix`: '\@rst-ignore-node'

`ignore_tree_prefix`: '\@rst-ignore-tree'

`option_prefix`: '\@rst-option'

`options_prefix`: '\@rst-options'

`preformat_prefix`: '\@rst-preformat'

`rst_prefix`: '\@rst'

`show_headline_prefix`: '\@rst-head'</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.7">It is often convenient to set options in headlines.  This is done with the following **headline commands**:

@rst TEXT
    Enter rst mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-code TEXT
    Enter code mode.  Create a section called TEXT provided the show_headlines option is set.

@rst-ignore-node TEXT
    Suppress all output from a single node. TEXT is ignored.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-ignore-tree TEXT and @rst-ignore TEXT
    Suppress all output from the node and its descendants.  TEXT is ignored.
    Does **not** change any rst3 formatting option.

@rst-no-head TEXT
    Suppress the generation of an rST section for this node only.  Does not affect descendant nodes.
    Has *no* effect on descendant nodes and does **not** change any rst3 option. 

@rst-no-headlines TEXT
    Set the show_headlines option to False.  As a result, TEXT is ignored.

@rst-option &lt;option&gt; = &lt;value&gt;
    Set a single option to the given value.  The default value is True.

@rst-options TEXT
    Set zero or more options from the body text of the node.  TEXT is ignored.
    The entire body text is treated as if it were in an @ @rst-options doc part.
    
@rst-preformat TEXT
    Format the entire body text of the node as if the entire text preformatted.
    TEXT is ignored. In effect, a line containing '::' is added to the start of
    the text, and all following lines of the text are indented. This option has
    no effect on descendant nodes.

**Notes**:

- Several of these commands affect only the node in which they appear.  Such commands set internal settings variables only: they have no effect on the visible rst3 options.

- If a headline generates an rST section, the section name does not include the headline command.  Furthermore, no rST section is generated if the TEXT is empty.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.8">Recall that in Leo a doc part starts with the '@' directive and continues until the end of body text or until the '@c' directive is seen.  For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

Leo converts doc parts into comments using whatever comment delimiters are in effect.

**Option doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-options. All other
lines of such doc parts should be of the form name=value. (rST comments lines
starting with '..' are allowed). For example::

    @ @rst-options
    .. This comment line is ignored.
    show_headlines=False
    show_leo_directives=False
    verbose=True
    @c

The rst3 plugin sets options from option doc parts, even in code mode.

**Markup doc parts** are doc parts that start with @ @rst-markup.  For example::

    @ @rst-markup
    .. contents::

The rst3 plugin replaces markup doc parts by the markup they contain, even in code mode.

Option and markup doc parts are especially useful in code mode. They allow you
to specify options or insert rST markup directly from with derived files. This
makes your source files self contained: there is no need to add other nodes to
make the rst3 plugin happy.

A cool feature: In code mode, rST markup in *ordinary* doc parts will be
rendered properly when the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option is in effect.
*Important*: Regardless of the show_doc_parts_as_paragraphs option, doc parts
have no special significance in rst mode. That is, the entire `doc part` from
the opening '@' to the closing '@c and everything in between are treated normal
rST markup.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.9">You can set the defaults for any rst3 option in several ways:

\1.  By setting options in the root node using @ @rst-options doc parts.
For example, the root of the file that generated this documentation contains::

    @ @rst-options
    code_mode=False
    doc_mode_only=False
    generate_rst=True
    show_organizer_nodes=True
    show_headlines=True
    show_leo_directives=True
    verbose=True
    @c

\2. By setting options in @settings trees.  To do this, you must prefix the option name shown in this documentation with the prefix 'rst3\_'.  For example::

    @settings
        @bool rst3_write_intermediate_file = True
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.10">This plugin defines a code-block rST directive.  The primary purpose of this directive is to show formatted source code.

In rst mode you can insert the code-block directive like any other rST markup.  The rst3 plugin generates code-block directives when handling nodes in code mode.

This directive takes one argument, a language name.  Like this::

    .. code-block:: Python

        import leoPlugins
        import leoGlobals as g

This directive syntax colors the code in the indented code block that follows the directive.
The result looks like this if the SilverCity syntax coloring module has been installed.

.. code-block:: Python
    
    import leoPlugins
    import leoGlobals as g

Otherwise, the output looks like this::

    import leoPlugins
    import leoGlobals as g

See the tree called "Scripting chapter using the rst plugin" in LeoDocs.leo for many examples of how to use code-blocks.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.11">HTML files generated by the rst3 plugin assume that three .css (cascading style sheet) files exist
in the same directory. For the HTML output to look good the following .css
files should exist:

- default.css is the default style sheet that docutils expects to exist.

- leo_rst.css contains some style improvements based on Gunnar Schwant's DocFactory.

- silver_city.css is the style sheet that controls the syntax highlighting generated by SilverCity.

The latter two style sheets are imported at the end of the default.css.

**Important:** You can use cascading style sheets to do things that otherwise
wouldn't be possible with "plain" rST. For instance, the background color of
this page was specified in a body style.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.12">The plugin reserves the '#' character for your own use so that you can
specify an rST headline explicitly. For example,::

    #####
    Title
    #####

You would typically put such a title in the rst root node. Otherwise, you should
let the rst3 plugin automatically generate rST sections from headlines.

To create a table of contents (TOC) put::

    .. contents:: Table of Contents

on its own line wherever you want the TOC to appear.  This line can appear in body text in rst mode,
or in an @ @rst-markup doc part in code mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.13">The file ListManagerDocs.html_ is an impressive example of the kind of output
that can be generated relatively easily using this plugin.

The source for ListManagerDocs.html is wxListManager.leo_.
**Important**: wxListManager.leo was written for the rst2 plugin; it
could be greatly simplified if adapted for the rst3 plugin.

The files in LeoDocs.leo under the node 'Leo's HTML Users Guide' contain
examples of using the rst3 plugin.

This documentation was created using the rst3 plugin. The source code for this
documentation is in LeoDocs.leo. The source code for all the rst plugins is in
LeoPlugins.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050818163826.14">The code for the rst3 plugin is more complex than usual.  Fortunately, the overall organization is straightforward.

defaultOptionsDict
    This dictionary represents each rst3 option.
    To add another option, just add another entry to this dictionary.
    Keys are the option name, including the `rst3_` prefix.
    Values are the default value of the option.
    The hard values in the dictionary may be changed as the result of @settings entries.

processTree
    processTree is the top-level code that handles one rst root node.
    It calls preprocessTree to create the **tnodeOptionDict** ivar.
    processTree then calls either writeNormalTree or writeSpecialTree
    depending on whether text will be sent to docutils for further processing.
    These two methods handle mundane details of opening an closing files.
    Both writeNormalTree and writeSpecialTree call **writeTree** to do the actual work.

tnodeOptionDict
    The entries in this dictionary represents the options that are set in one particular node.
    The keys of tnodeOptionDict are tnodes, the values are anonymous dictionaries.
    These anonymous inner dictionaries contain the options that are explicitly set at each tnode
    (and thus each position).
    Preprocessing the tree this way ensures that each node (headline and body text) is parsed exactly once.

writeTree
    writeTree first calls **scanAllOptions**, which has the effect of
    initializing all options. writeTree then calls **writeNode** for each node
    that will be processed by the rst3 plugin. Options may cause the plugin to
    skip a node or an entire subtree.

writeNode
    writeNode first calls **scanAllOptions** to compute the options that are in
    effect for that *single* node. Once options have computed, processing the
    node is straightforward. writeNode calls writeBody and writeHeadline
    to do the real work. These methods generate or skip text based on various
    options.

scanAllOptions
    scanAllOptions recreates the optionsDict ivar to represent *all* the options
    in effect for *for the particular node being processed by writeNode*. Client
    code gets these options by calling the getOption method.

    scanAllOptions first inits all options from settings,
    then updates those options using the anonymous
    dictionaries contained in the tnodeOptionsDict.
    scanAllOptions works like g.scanAllDirectives, but the code is much simpler.</t>

[1]_ Footnote 1.

[2]_ Footnote 2.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050822173420">The main window represents an entire project and is stored in a single **Leo file**,
a file with a .leo extension.
As you can see, the main window contains three panes:
the **outline pane** at the top left,
the **log pane** at the top right, and the **body pane** at the bottom.
The window also contains an **icon area** at the very top and a **status area** at the very bottom.

Outline pane &amp; nodes
    The outline pane shows your project as an outline.
    The outline contains all your project's data.
    An outline consists of **nodes**.
    Nodes have two parts, a **headline** and **body text**.
    The outline pane shows headlines.
    **Selecting a headline selects the entire node**; the node's body text appears in the body pane.
    The **icon box** is a small icon directly to the left of the headline text.
    If a node contains children, a smaller icon appears to the left of the icon box.
    This icon contains a ``+`` or ``-`` symbol.
    Clicking this **expansion box** expands or contracts the node.

Body pane
    The body pane contains the body text of the node selected in the outline pane.
    You can control how Leo shows body text using `Leo directives`_ and settings_.
    For example, directives specify whether to syntax color the body text and whether to wrap the text.

Log pane
    The log pane contains informational messages from Leo.
    Scripts_ and plugins_ may also write message to the log pane.

Icon area
    Depending on what plugins are enabled,
    the icon area may contain buttons and other widgets that extend what Leo can do.
    The scripting plugin makes it easy to add buttons to the icon area.

Status area
    The status area shows the line and column containing the body text's cursor.
    Other information may follow.
    Usually this is the **UNL** (Uniform Node Location) that describes the path in the outline
    to the selected node.
    Please select nodes at several levels of the outline to see how the UNL changes.

Now that we are familiar with Leo's main window,
let's see how to use Leo as a simple outliner.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050822173420.1">You don't have to store all outline data in Leo (.leo) files.
Leo allows you to store outline data in external files called **derived files**.
This is useful for creating programming files, documentation files such as LaTeX files, and web pages.

**Important**:
You can edit `derived files`_ outside of Leo.
Leo will update the outline to reflect those changes when Leo next opens the outline_.

It is easy to create derived files; just put ``@thin`` *filename* in a headline_.
That creates an **@thin node**.
The **@thin tree** (the ``@thin`` node and all its descendants) corresponds to the derived file *filename*.
Leo writes a `derived file`_ corresponding to the ``@thin`` tree to your hard drive when Leo saves your outline (.leo file).
When opening a .leo file, Leo reads all the `derived files`_ corresponding to ``@thin`` nodes in the outline_.

**Note**: you can ``@file`` instead of ``@thin`` to create derived files.
``@thin`` is more friendly to CVS and other Source Code Control Systems.
This tutorial only discusses `@thin`_ nodes_.
A good rule of thumb is to use `@thin`_ nodes_ unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
See `Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo`_ for a full discussions of the various ways of creating `derived files`_.

**Important**:
You must tell Leo the order in which to write data from the ``@thin`` tree to the `derived file`_.
The simplest way to specify the contents of a derived file is to insert::

    @all

in the body text of the `@thin`_ node_.
``@all`` is a Leo `directive`_.

When writing a `derived file`_, Leo writes the `body text`_ of the `@thin`_ node_,
replacing the ``@all`` directive by the `body text`_ of all the descendant_ nodes_ in **outline order**,
the order that nodes appear on the screen when all nodes are expanded.
`Leo for Programmers`_ discusses other, more flexible, ways of creating derived files from `@thin`_ trees.
**Note**: Leo copies headlines to the derived file as comments.
This means that headlines_ do not affect the meaning of `derived files`_ and
you can use headlines_ to contain whatever data you wish.
Usually, headlines_ describe what's in the node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050822173420.2">A **cloned node** is a copy of a node_ that changes when the original changes.
Changes to the children_, grandchildren_, etc. of a node are simultaneously made
to the corresponding nodes contained in all cloned nodes. A small red arrow in
icon boxes marks clones.

Please take a few moments to experiment with clones. Start with a single node,
say a node_ whose headline_ is A. Clone node A using the ``Clone Node`` command_
in Leo's Outline menu. Both clones are identical; there is no distinction
between the original node and any of its clones.

Type some text into the body of either node A. The same text appears in the
bodies of all other clones_ of A. Now insert a node, say B, as a child of any of
the A nodes. All the A nodes now have a B child. See what happens if you clone
B. See what happens if you insert, delete or move nodes that are children_ of A.
Verify that when the second-to-last cloned node is deleted the last cloned node
becomes a regular node again.

Clones are much more than a cute feature. **Clones allow multiple views of data
to exist within a single outline**. The ability to create multiple views of data
is crucial; you don't have to try to decide what is the 'correct' view of data.
You can create as many views as you like, each tailored exactly to the task at hand.

To create a new view of the data, just create any *ordinary* node. This node
will *represent* the new view. Let us call it a **view node.** Now just put any
nodes that are related to the view as descendant nodes of your view node. Let us
call the descendants of the view nodes the **components** of the view. Component
nodes are typically clones of other nodes in the outline. This is what gives the
view its power: a view can contain nodes gathered from all over the outline.
However, it is also sometimes useful to add non-cloned nodes as components of
views.

For example, when I begin to fix a bug I first create a view node to represent
the bug. I then create a component node (not cloned) that contains the original
bug report. I may also create other non-cloned nodes to contain notes and
documentation. Next, I go looking throughout Leo's code for nodes that relate in
some way to the bug. When I find such a node I clone it and move one of the
clones so it becomes a component of the view node for the bug. **Note**: I can
organize the components of the view node as I please. In particular, I can
create **organizer nodes** whose only purpose is to contain groups of component
nodes. In other words, the full power of Leo outlines is available within view
nodes.

**Important**: Once I have created the view of the bug, I can concentrate *only*
on that view. In particular, I can fix code by changing *component* nodes.
Because the code nodes are cloned, any changes I make to a component node also
get made to the other cloned nodes throughout the outline. In effect, my view
node for the bug lets me work only on the nodes of the outline that are directly
related to the bug. In other words, the view nodes lets me focus *only* on the
task at hand, and lets me ignore all other details.

Clones are the basis for Leo's project management capabilities. Indeed, the
ability to create multiple views of a project is most helpful.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050822173420.3">Leo directives control such things as syntax coloring, line wrapping within the body pane and the width of tabs.
Leo directives may appear in headlines or body text.
Leo directives start with '@' in the leftmost column, followed by the name of the directive.  Some examples::

    @language python
    @tabwidth -4
    @wrap
    @nowrap
    @color
    @nocolor
    @killcolor

The following directives are useful for non-programmers;
`Directives for programming`_ lists the directives used for computer programming.

- **\@color**, **\@nocolor** and **\@killcolor** control syntax coloring.
 
- **\@language** sets the language used for syntax coloring.

- **\@tabwidth** sets the width of tabs.
  Negative tab widths cause Leo to convert tabs to spaces
  (highly recommended for Python programming.)

- **\@wrap** and **\@nowrap** enable or disable line wrapping the Leo's body pane.

**Note**:
You can mix ``@nocolor`` and ``@color`` directives in a single node_,
but these directives apply to descendant_ nodes only if they are **unambiguous**, that is,
only if the ancestor node contains exactly one ``@color`` or ``@nocolor`` directive.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050822173420.5">Leo is fully scriptable using the Python language.
**Leo can execute any body text as a Python script**.
To run the entire body text as a script, simply choose the node and execute the ``Execute Script`` command_.
If text is selected, the ``Execute Script`` command_ will run just the selected text as the script.

The ``Execute Script`` command_ **preprocesses** the script before executing it.
Leo preprocesses scripts in exactly the same way that Leo writes derived files.
That is,
**Leo expands section references and processes @others directives** before executing the script.
This allows you to use all of Leo's normal capabilities to organize your scripts.
**Note**: ``test.leo`` contains dozens of examples of using Leo outline structure to organize stand-alone scripts.

Your Python scripts can easily access data in an outline.  For example, the following script will print all the headlines in an outline::

    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        print ' '*p.level(),p.headString()

Your scripts can use outline structure to avoid having to parse data.
With a little forethought you can arrange outlines to make scripts easier to write.
The example above is only the beginning of what scripts can do.
See `Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python`_ for a complete discussion of scripting.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050823081317.1">**Plugins** are Python modules that change how Leo works, yet are not part of Leo's core code. 
Leo's user have contributed dozens of plugins that have extended Leo's capabilities in many new directions.
The file ``leoPlugins.leo`` contains all plugins that are included in Leo distributions.

Plugins and other parts of Leo can get options from **@settings** trees,
outlines whose headline is ``@settings``. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks
for ``@settings`` trees in the outline being opened and also in various
``leoSettings.leo`` files. ``@settings`` trees allow plugins to get options without
any further support from Leo's core code. For a full discussion of
``@settings`` trees, see `Chapter 8: Customizing Leo`_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050823082517">You can use Leo as fairly typical outliner. Play around with some of the
commands from the Outline menu:

- Click the expansion box of nodes_ to show and hide their children.

- The ``Insert Node`` command_ inserts a new headline into the outline.

- The ``Delete Node`` command_ deletes a headline and all its children.

- The ``Move Up``, ``Move Down``, ``Move Left`` and ``Move Right`` commands_ move the currently selected node,
  along with all its descendants. 

- The ``Promote`` command_ makes all the children_ of a headline siblings of the headline.
  The ``Demote`` command_ makes all following siblings_ of a headline children of the headline.

- You can cut, copy and paste entire nodes_ (including their descendants) with
  the Cut Node, Copy Node and Paste Node commands_.

- We'll discuss the ``Clone Node`` command_ in the next section.

You enter `body text`_ for any node by selecting the node's headline in the
outline pane and then typing in the body pane. Leo has a full range of `editing
commands`_ that apply to the body pane.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050824151926">So far we have discussed features that Leo shares with other editors and outliners.
The following sections explain what makes Leo unique.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827055403">So far we have been focusing on Leo's outline pane: creating and cloning_ nodes_.
In fact, *outline structure affects all aspects of Leo*.
For example:

-   As mentioned earlier, body text can contain `Leo directives`_ that control how Leo works.
    By default, a Leo directive applies to a node and all its descendants_,
    but a Leo directive in a descendant node can **override** a directive in an ancestor_ node.

-   Programs in `body text`_ can contain optional markup consisting of sections_ and section references_.
    (See `Quick start for programmers`_ for details.)
    Leo outlines limits the visibility of such sections:
    sections_ must be defined in a node descending from the node containing the `section reference`_.

-   You can organize scripts and programs using outlines, and scripts can use
    outline structure to access data. Plugins_ and scripts_ often confine their
    effects to the presently selected outline.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827061847">**Doc parts** are blocks of text that Leo treats as comments.
Leo syntax colors doc parts as comments,
and Leo converts doc parts into comments in derived files.
Doc parts start with an ``@`` directive and continue until
an ``@c`` directive or the end of the body text.
For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

Doc parts are entirely optional;
you could simply use comments in the language specified by the ``@language`` directive_.
Using doc parts for lengthy comments is convenient, however.
Not only do you not need to specify comment delimiters,
but Leo breaks doc parts into lines automatically.
The ``@pagewidth`` directive specifies the width of those lines.

**Notes**:

- In body text, everything not in a doc part is in a **code part**.
  If a node does not contain a doc part, the entire body text is a code part.

- ``@doc`` is a synonym for ``@`` and ``@code`` is a synonym for ``@c``.
  However, ``@`` and ``@c`` are preferred.

- A doc part of the form::
	
    @ %def identifiers

declares that the preceding code part contains the list of identifiers.
Whitespace separate the identifiers; everything else is taken to be the
identifiers. This construct is a convention of the noweb_ language, and will be
of use *only* for those who want to create .nw output files for use with the
official noweb_ system.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827090532">`@thin trees`_ (parts of the outline whose *headline* starts with @thin)
create `derived files`_ containing your program.
Within ``@thin trees`` you can write *functional pseudo-code*, like this::

    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;  (in body text)

This is a **reference** to a **section** called ``&lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;``.
When writing a `derived file`_,
Leo replaces all section references by their definition.
You define sections with **section definition nodes**.
A section definition node is a node_ whose headline_ starts with a `section name`_::

    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;   (in a headline)

The `body text`_ of this node_ is its definition.  For example::

    import leoGlobals as g
    import sys

As you can see, `section definitions`_ can be *fragments* of code;
they don't have to be complete functions or methods.

**Notes**:

-   `Section definition nodes`_ must be descendants_ of the node_ containing the `section reference`_.
    Leo's syntax colorer underlines undefined `section references`_.

-   `Section definitions`_ may contain references to other sections_.

-   The **@others** directive_ is a special kind of `section reference`_.
    Leo replaces the ``@others`` directive by the body text of all descendant_ nodes_
    *except* `section definition nodes`_.
    That's how ``@others`` got its name.
    For example, the `root node`_ of Python `derived files`_ typically is something like this::

        &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
        &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
        @others

    The `derived file`_ will contain the docstring, followed by the imports, followed by the
    the body text of all other nodes in the ``@file`` tree, in `outline order`_.
    
- A `derived file`_ may contain multiple ``@others`` directives_: Each
  ``@others`` directive expands to the body text of all descendant_ nodes_,
  excluding any nodes (and *their* descendants) that contain other ``@others``
  directives_. In practice, using ``@others`` is easy.

- You may precede `section references`_ (including the ``@others`` directive_)
  with whitespace. When expanding the section references, Leo inserts the
  preceding whitespace before every expanded line. For example, the following
  will work properly in Python::

    if path:
        &lt;&lt; create or recreate temp file as needed &gt;&gt;

*You now know enough to understand Leo's source code*.  Hurray!
The following sections discuss some relatively minor details.
However, I recommend reading `Good style and bad`_;
you might save yourself some extra work.

**New in Leo 4.4.4**:
`@auto trees`_ allow you to edit derived files that do not contain sentinels.
Leo imports such derived files every time Leo reads the .leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827090802">``LeoPy.leo`` (in the src subdirectory of the leo folder) contains almost all of Leo's source code.
It provides hundreds of examples of everything discussed here.
This file will repay close study.
For full details on all aspects of Leo see ``LeoDocs.leo`` or `Leo's Users Guide`_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827094813">Newcomers to Leo frequently ask when to use the `@others`_ directive_ and when
to use sections_. It is good style to use `section references`_ only when the
order of text within a `derived file`_ matters. For example, Python programmers
put docstrings and imports at the start of files. So the `body text`_ of
`@file`_ nodes typically look something like this::

    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    @language python
    @tabwidth -4
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    @others

This ensures that the docstring is first in the file, followed by imports,
followed by everything else. Note that the order in which functions are defined
in a file, or methods defined within a class, typically does *not* matter. Thus,
it is good style to define classes like this::

  class myClass:
        &lt;&lt; class attributes &gt;&gt;
        @others

It would be bad style to define a class like this::

  class myClass:
        &lt;&lt; class attributes &gt;&gt;
        &lt;&lt; method 1 &gt;&gt;
        &lt;&lt; method 2 &gt;&gt;
        ...

Not only does this over-specify the order in which methods are defined, but it
requires lots of extra typing. Not only must you add a line for each method, but
headlines must contain section names such as &lt;&lt; method 1 &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;method 2&gt;&gt;, etc.
When using ``@others`` it is good style simply to put the name of each method in
the headline.

A few more words about style:

- It is good style to **put each class, function or method in its own node**.
  This makes it easy to see the shape of your code.

- It is good style to use `organizer nodes`_ to group related functions or methods.
  An organizer node has no content except maybe for comments.
  Like this::

    + myClass
        + birth and death
            + __init__
            etc.
        + getters
            etc.
        + setters
            etc.
        + misc methods
            etc.

  (In this notation, '+' denotes a headline.)
  This organization is far superior to using hideous comments like::

    ###########
    # Getters #
    ###########

- It is bad style to use `@others`_ in `organizer nodes`_.
  There is no need to do so.

- It is bad style to use `@others`_ when order does matter.
  The reason is that it is very easy to move nodes in a tree by mistake,
  say by alphabetizing nodes.
  One wants to make the meaning of a derived file immune from such movements.

One last word about style. The world won't end if you happen to use bad style by
mistake: you just might cause a bit more work for yourself than was strictly
necessary. Feel free to invent your own style of using Leo. Still, it would be
wise to "know the rules before you break them."
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827102655">The previous sections have discussed the basics of Leo.
*Non-programmers can stop reading this tutorial now*!

The following sections tell how to create derived files that contain computer
programs. Yes, you could create program files using the ``@all`` directive, but
the following section explain how you can take advantage of **power-user**
features designed specifically for computer programmers. Even if you don't read
manuals, please read the following short `Quick start for programmers`_ section.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827155902">A section name has the form::

    &lt;&lt; any text &gt;&gt;

`Any text` is just that: *any* sequence of text not containing '&gt;&gt;'.  For example::

    &lt;&lt; initialize ivars &gt;&gt;

Leo ignores case and whitespace in section names, so the following are all equivalent::

    &lt;&lt; Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; peanut butter&amp;jelly &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;peanut butter &amp; jelly&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;peanutbutter&amp;jelly&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;PEANUTBUTTER&amp;JELLY&gt;&gt;

When ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` are not paired on a line,
they are treated as ordinary ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` characters.
Leo has *no* escape mechanism for section names.
That is, paired ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` characters on the same line always denote a section name,
*even within comments and strings*.
This means that ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` characters that do not delimit a section name must be placed on separate lines.
In practice, this requirement seldom causes problems.

The syntax of section names is based on Norman Ramsey's `noweb`_ markup language,
but without noweb's escape conventions.
Eliminating these escape conventions may seem odd,
but it has turned out to be one of the best design decisions I ever made.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050827162537">Leo can support a style of programming similar to `Literate Programming`_ (LP).
LP has a bad reputation in some quarters. That's too bad; Leo fixes all the
problems with traditional LP. See `Chapter 6: Leo and Literate Programming`_ in
`Leo's Users Guide`_ for more details. *Please* don't let the words 'Literate
Programming' get in the way of your using Leo effectively. That would be *your*
mistake, and a big one.</t>

Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo
#####################################
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.1">This chapter is a *reference guide* to computer programming with Leo.
This chapter does *not* teach you how to use Leo:
for that you should read `Leo's tutorial`_.
This chapter assumes you are thoroughly familiar with the terminology introduced in the tutorial.
**Note**: Are you *sure* you want to read this chapter?
It contains many details that are no interest to the average user of Leo.
I recommend using Leo for two weeks, or longer, before attempting this chapter.

.. contents::</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.30">The following sections give full details about each directive.
The directives listed here may appear in headlines or body text.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.31">The ``@all`` directive is valid only in ``@thin`` trees.
The ``@all`` directive is similar to ``@others``, but it is less restrictive:
it dumps *all* nodes to the derived file, including ``@ignore`` nodes and nodes that
in an ``@others`` tree would be considered to be orphan nodes.

The ``@all`` directive is required for files such as ``@thin leoProjects.txt`` in ``LeoPy.leo``.
``leoProjects.txt`` contains so-called project nodes.
It doesn't have any meaning as a program file: it is simply a collection of unrelated data.
``@others`` would not work at all: it would complain about lots of orphan nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.32">Syntax coloring is on by default in all body text.
Leo formats comments and documentation parts in red,
directives and C keywords in blue,
strings and character constants in gray and all other text in code parts in black.
The ``@nocolor`` directive disables syntax coloring for the body text in which it appears.
No syntax coloring is done until an ``@color`` directive re-enables syntax coloring.

If a node contains neither the ``@color`` nor the ``@nocolor`` directive
it may inherit the syntax coloring attribute from an ancestor.
The nearest ancestor that contains exactly one of the ``@color`` or ``@nocolor`` directives
will control the syntax coloring.
**Ambiguous nodes**, nodes containing both the ``@color`` and ``@nocolor`` directives,
never affect the coloring of their offspring.

The ``@killcolor`` directive completely disables the colorizer for that node.
The result much faster syntax coloring of large body text.
As usual ``@killcolor`` may itself be overridden in descendant nodes.
The differences between ``@killcolor`` and ``@nocolor``:

- ``@nocolor`` suppresses coloring only until the next ``@color`` directive.

- ``@killcolor`` overrides ``@nocolor`` and ``@color`` directives.
  Any node containing @killcolor is unambiguously a ``@killcolor`` node regardless of
  whether that node also contains ``@color`` or ``@nocolor`` directives.

**Note**:
the ``@color``, ``@nocolor`` and ``@killcolor`` directives do not affect the ``Tangle`` commands in any way.
In particular, the ``Tangle`` commands will recognize section definitions as usual even
after an ``@nocolor`` directive is seen.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.33">**Note**:
the ``@comment`` directive is deprecated:
you should use the ``@language`` directive whenever possible.
However, sometimes using both ``@language`` and ``@comment`` is useful.
For this to be effective the ``@comment`` directive should appear after the ``@language`` directive (in outline order).

The ``Untangle`` command will not process an ``@root`` or ``@unit`` node if
an ``@comment`` directive is in effect because
``Untangle`` can't be sure of properly parsing a derived file if the language of the derived file isn't known.
It might be possible to assume some defaults in this case,
but that is not done at present and is not a high priority.
By default, the ``Tangle`` commands produces C-language comments.
Single-line comments generated during tangling start with ``///``,
while documentation parts are surrounded by ``/*`` and ``*/``.
The ``@comment`` directive allows you to use ``Tangle`` to produce shell and make files,
as well as source code for other programming languages.

The ``@comment`` directive may be followed by zero to three delimiters, separated by whitespace.
This directive sets the single-line comment delimiter and the opening and closing block comment delimiters as follows:

====================== =====================================================================
\@comment              no args\: restores the defaults to ///, /\* and \*/
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment ///          \1 arg\: sets the single-line comment and clears the other delims.
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment /\* \*/      \2 args\: sets the block comment delims; clears the single-line delim.
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment /// /\* \*/  \3 args\: sets all three delimiters.
====================== =====================================================================

If only one delimiter is given, Leo does not write any documentation parts while tangling.
If two delimiters are given, block-style comments are used instead of single-line comments.
For example, the ``@comment { }`` directive could be used to tangle Pascal files.

The ``@comment`` directive is only recognized in ``@root``, ``@unit`` or ``@file`` nodes,
and the ``@comment`` directive must precede the first section name or ``@code`` directive.
An ``@comment`` directive in the body text of an ``@unit`` directive specifies the current global defaults.
An ``@comment`` directive in the body text of an ``@root`` directive affects comments generated for one root only.
Comments in all other roots are governed by the global defaults.

Leo will convert underscores in the ``@comment`` directives to significant spaces.  For example::

    @comment REM_

causes the comment delimiter to be "REM " (Note the trailing space).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.34">The ``@delims`` directive changes the comment strings used to mark sentinel lines.
This directive is often used to place Javascript text inside XML or HTML files.
The ``delims`` directive is not valid in ``@root`` or ``@unit`` trees.

The ``@delims`` directive contains one or two delimiters, separated by whitespace.
If only one delim is present it delimits single-line comments.
If two delims are present they delimit block comments.
The ``@delims`` directive can not be used to change the comment strings at the start of the derived file,
that is, the comment strings for the ``@+leo`` sentinel and the initial ``@+body`` and ``@+node`` sentinels.

The ``@delims`` directive inserts ``@@delims`` sentinels into the derived file.
The new delimiter strings continue in effect until the next ``@@delims`` sentinel in the derived file or
the end of the derived file.

**Note**: Leo can not revert to previous delimiters automatically;
you must change back to previous delimiters using another ``@delims`` directive. For example::

    @delims /* */
    Javascript stuff
    @delims &lt;-- --&gt;
    HTML stuff

Adding, deleting or changing ``@@delims`` sentinels will destroy Leo's ability to read the derived file.
Mistakes using the ``@delims`` directive have no effect on Leo,
though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a derived file as far as compilers,
HTML renderers, etc. are concerned.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.35">You may use the ``@encoding`` directive to specify the encoding used in a derived file.
You can't mix encodings in a single derived file.  For example::

    @encoding iso-8859-1

If the encoding used in a derived file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line, like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

The ``utf-8`` encoding is used by default.
The ``utf-8`` encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all unicode code points),
so encoding and decoding to and from ``utf-8`` plain strings will never cause a problem.
When reading or writing a character not in a "lossy" encoding (such as ``iso-8859-1``),
Leo converts such characters to ``'?'`` and issues a warning. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.36">The ``@first`` directive allows you to place lines at the very start of files derived from ``@file`` nodes.
For example, the body text of ``@file spam.py`` might be::

	@first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of ``@file foo.perl`` might be::

	@first #/usr/bin/perl

``@first`` directives are recognized only at the start of the body text of ``@file`` nodes.
No text may precede ``@first`` directives.
More than one ``@first`` directive may exist, like this::

	@first #! /usr/bin/env python
	@first # more comments.

The ``@first`` directive is not valid in ``@root`` or ``@unit`` trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.37">The ``@language`` directive specifies the comment delimiters and string types used by the
``Tangle`` and ``Untangle`` commands.
This directive over-rides the default specified in the settings dialog.

When the threading_colorizer plugin is enabled, the valid @language directives are::

    @language x
    
where the leo/modes folder contains the file x.py.  When the threading_colorizier plugin is not enabled,
the 'old' colorizer is used and the valid ``@language`` directives are::

    @language actionscript
    @language c
    @language c++
    @language cweb
    @language elisp
    @language html
    @language java
    @language latex
    @language objective-c
    @language pascal
    @language perl
    @language perlpod
    @language plain
    @language python
    @language rebol
    @language shell
    @language tcltk

Shell files have comments that start with `#`.
Case is ignored in the language specifiers, but not in the ``@language`` itself.
Thus, the following are equivalent::

    @language html
    @language HTML
    @language hTmL

but the following is invalid::

    @LANGUAGE html</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.38">The ``@lineending`` directive sets the line endings for individual derived files.
This directive will override the ``output_newline`` setting.
The ``@lineending`` *never* affects the line endings in .leo files themselves:
.leo files must have consistent line endings!

The valid forms of the ``@lineending`` directive are:

======================= ======================================================
\@lineending nl         The default, Linux.
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending cr         Mac
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending crlf       Windows
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending lf         Same as 'nl', not recommended
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending platform   Same as platform value for ``output_newline`` setting.
======================= ======================================================</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.39">The ``@path`` directives override the deprecated ``default_tangle_directory`` setting.

The form of the @path directive is ``@path`` *filename*,
where *filename* is taken to be everything following @path to the end of the line.

If *filename* is an absolute filename the location of the derived file is specified only by the filename.
Otherwise, if *filename* is a relative filename, the location of the derived file is relative to:
	
1. the directory specified the applicable ``@path`` directive, or
2. the "Default Tangle Directory" in the Settings dialog if no ``@path`` directive is in effect, or
3. the directory in which the .leo file resides if the .leo file has ever been saved.

An error occurs if no absolute path can be computed according to these rules,
or if *filename* does not exist.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.40">The ``@raw`` and ``@end_raw`` directives are valid only within ``@file`` trees.
The ``@raw`` directive starts a section of "raw" text.
The ``@end_raw`` directive ends such a section, as does the end of body text.
No section references are recognized within raw text,
and no additional leading whitespace is generated within raw text when writing the derived file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.41">Leo allows you to choose whether body text in ``@root`` trees will start in code mode or doc mode by default.
``@root-doc`` *filename* and ``@root-code`` *filename* directives
specify that body text is assumed to start in doc mode or code mode respectively.
The options (``-doc`` and ``-code``) must follow ``@root`` immediately with no intervening whitespace.
In effect, ``@root-code`` and ``@root-doc`` are two new directives.

These ``@root`` options override the ``at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode`` setting.
This setting affects only @root trees without options.
Such "plain" ``@root`` trees are now deprecated,
which only means that it is better style to use either ``@root-code`` or ``@root-doc``.
The reason is simple:
the meaning of plain ``@root`` trees will depend on the ``at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode`` setting.
It's better to be explicit.
By default, ``at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode = 1`` for compatibility for old ``@root`` trees.
I actually don't think this option is good for much;
I created it before I created ``@root-doc`` and ``@root-code`` settings,
and I decided it wouldn't hurt to leave it in.
Anyway, you now have complete flexibility about how ``@root`` works,
and in particular you can make ``@root`` work just like ``@file``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.42">By default, the ``body_pane_wraps`` setting controls whether body text wraps.
You may override this setting for a particular tree using the ``@wrap`` and ``@nowrap`` directives.
Only the first ``@wrap`` or ``@nowrap`` directive in a node has any effect.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.43">See `CWEB`_ for a discussion of the CWEB language.
CWEB mode refers to how Leo tangles an outline when ``@language cweb`` is in effect or
the ``cweb`` setting is in effect.
Leo treats *all* cweb code in cweb mode as unevaluated text.
That is, Leo treats cweb control codes, including
``@&lt;...@&gt;``, ``@&lt;..@&gt;=``, ``@c``, ``@``, ``@*`` and ``@**`` as "raw" text within cweb mode.
Leo does *not* expand *cweb* section references when writing derived files in cweb mode.
However, Leo *does* expand *noweb* section references,
so you may use noweb sections to organize cweb files!
You can create *noweb* code and doc sections using the ``@code`` and ``@doc`` directives
in place of ``@c`` and ``@`` directives.

By default, cweb colors ``@``, ``@*`` and ``@**`` sections using the same syntax coloring as for ``LaTeX``.
In addition, cweb colors ``C`` ``//`` and ``/*..*/`` comments using ``LaTeX`` coloring by default.
You may change these defaults using the
``color_cweb_doc_parts_with_latex`` and ``color_cweb_comments_with_latex`` settings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.45">This section discusses all aspects of ``@root`` trees.
You should carefully consider whether the extra flexibility afforded by
``@root`` trees is worth the extra bother.
Indeed, ``@file`` trees are much easier to use than ``@root`` trees:

- ``@file`` trees use less markup than ``@root`` trees.
  In particular, the @others directive is valid only within ``@file`` trees.

- You must explicitly tangle and untangle ``@root`` trees using the ``Tangle`` and ``Untangle`` commands.

However, ``@root`` trees are more flexible than ``@file`` trees:

- Sections may be defined anywhere within ``@root`` trees.
  Moreover, the ``@unit`` directive expands the scope of section definitions in ``@root`` trees
  so that a section may be referenced in several ``@root`` trees.

- The meaning of section definitions in ``@root`` trees are independent of their position within the tree.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.47">Just as with ``@file`` trees, ``@root`` trees may contain code parts and doc parts.
Code parts start with section definition lines (see below) or the ``@c`` directive.
Doc parts start with ``@`` directive.
Doc parts continue until the end of body text or until the next ``@c`` or ``@`` directive.

Body text in ``@root`` trees contain zero or more code and doc parts in any order.
The ``@c`` directive starts a named code section if the node's headline starts with ``&lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;``.
Otherwise, the ``@c`` directive is invalid.

**Section definition lines** are lines of the form::

	&lt;&lt; section name&gt;&gt;=

(note the equal sign).
Such lines also start named code parts.
Named code parts in ``@root`` trees may be defined in several places.
The definition of a named code part is the concatenation of all code parts with the same name.
Body text that defines no code part is ignored.
At least one non-blank line must follow the section definition line;
empty sections are not allowed. 

As in ``@file`` trees, paired ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` characters on the same line always denote a section name,
even within comments and strings.
Thus, ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` characters that do not delimit a section name must be placed on separate lines.
If ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` are not paired on a line, they are treated as ordinary ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` characters.

Here is a typical example of body text within an @root tree::

    @ This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    &lt;&lt;atFile methods&gt;&gt;=
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)

Provided that the node's headline starts with &lt;&lt;atFile methods&gt;&gt;,
the example above is equivalent to::

    @ This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    @c
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)

We may not eliminate @c directives in @root trees.
If we convert the doc part to a comment we are left with::

    @c
    # This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)
    
The following escape convention applies only in ``@root`` trees.
Within a code part ``@@`` in the first column (and only in the first column) stands for a single ``@`` sign.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.48">Each ``@root`` tree represents a single derived file.
**Tangling** is the process of creating derived files from ``@file`` or ``@root`` trees.
Leo tangles ``@file`` trees automatically whenever an outline is saved.
The user must tangle ``@root`` trees explicitly using one of the ``Tangle`` commands.

Leo creates derived files by expanding all section references in an ``@root`` node.
Leo expands a section reference by substituting the code section itself for the section reference.
This is a recursive process:
the substituted code section may contain other code references which are themselves expanded, and so on.

The outline provides a natural way of organizing an sections as follows::

	Place the definition of a section S in a child of
	the node containing the reference to S.

If a section is referenced in more than one node,
I usually place its definition in a node containing all the nodes that refer to it.
Using this rule of thumb creates an outline whose structure mirrors the intrinsic organization of a program.

The ``Tangle`` command creates derived files from ``@root`` node.
The ``@root`` directive indicates which sections constitute an output file.
The text following a @root directive forms the entire content of the file,
that is, after section references are expanded.
An outline can contain arbitrarily many ``@root`` directives:
Leo's ``Tangle`` commands will create one output file for each.
The process of creating derived files is called "tangling" because
the code from the outline is rearranged to create the derived files.

For example, the following ``@root`` section shows a typical way of specifying a header file ``xx.h``::

    @root xx.h
    #ifndef xx_defined
    #define xx_defined
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public constants of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public types of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; public prototypes of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    #endif

The ``Tangle`` commands will create the file ``xx.h`` from this body text by expanding all the section references.
Incidentally, the introductory documentation will be included in the header file:
any text preceding the ``@root`` directive is treated just like the doc part of a section definition.

As another example, the following shows a typical way of specifying the corresponding ``xx.c`` file::

    @root xx.c
    &lt;&lt; public variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private types of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private function prototypes of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; methods of the xx class &gt;&gt;

There are three menu commands that tangle an outline: ``Tangle``, ``Tangle All`` and ``Tangle Marked``.
These commands are identical except for how much of the outline is tangled.
The ``Tangle`` command tangles only the selected portion of the outline,
the ``Tangle All`` command tangles the entire outline,
and the ``Tangle Marked`` command tangles only marked headlines.

The ``@root`` directive has three forms.
All three forms mean exactly the same thing::

    @root filename
    @root "filename"
    @root &lt;filename&gt;

If *filename* is an absolute filename the location of the derived file is specified only by the filename.
Otherwise, if the ``@root`` node contains a relative filename, the location of the derived file is relative to:
	
1. the directory specified by an ``@path`` directive, or

2. the ``default_tangle_directory`` setting if no ``@path`` directive is in effect, or

3. the directory in which the .leo resides if the .leo file has ever been saved.

An error occurs if no absolute path can be computed according to these rules,
or if the filename or directory does not exist.

The scope of a definition is the tree in which the definition is known.
By default, ``Tangle`` commands look for section definitions only
in the suboutline of the ``@root`` node being tangled.
That is, all sections are assumed to be defined either in the body text of the headline,
say h, containing the ``@root`` directive, or in the body texts of the descendants of h.
The ``@unit`` directive explicitly indicates the scope of section definitions.
When a ``Tangle`` command encounters the ``@unit`` directive it treats the suboutline containing
the ``@unit`` command as the scope for all enclosed roots.
This ensures that the group of roots in the subtree use the same section definitions.

For example, suppose we have a tree organized as follows::

	+ @unit
		+ @root A
		    sections in A
		+ @root B
		    sections in B
		
The ``@unit`` directive insures that
only sections defined in the unit can affect files A and B and
that all sections definitions in A and B are compatible with each other.

The ``Tangle`` commands ignore any tree containing an ``@ignore`` directive.
This ensures that trees that contain cloned nodes or other subsidiary information
do not cause the tangle commands to issue spurious error messages.
It also ensures that a tree can never contribute a section definition to another part of the outline by mistake.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.49">The ``Untangle``, ``Untangle All`` and ``Untangle Marked`` commands are the
reverse of the corresponding ``Tangle`` commands.
They update one or more ``@root`` nodes based on changes made to the corresponding derived files.

For example, suppose you create a new part of the outline and tangle it for the first time.
When you compile derived files for the first you are likely to get many syntax errors.
You could fix those errors in the outline and tangle the outline again, but there is a much easier way:
you fix the errors in the derived files using the compiler's editor,
then run the untangle command on the part of the outline that created the derived file.
The ``Untangle`` command updates the selected outline to match the changes in the derived files.
It's as simple as that.
By the way, the ``Untangle`` command marks all the nodes in the outline that it updates,
and you can examine all such nodes with the ``Go To Next Marked`` command in the ``Outline`` menu.

You cannot use ``Untangle`` to update doc parts, or leading comments in code parts or
"trivial" whitespace in code parts.
This is a limitation of the ``Untangle`` command that cannot be fixed;
``Untangle`` has no way of knowing whether leading comments came from doc parts or are just leading comments.

``Untangle`` never changes the structure of an outline;
it never inserts, deletes or moves nodes.
Don't attempt to change the structure of an outline by modifying derived files; it won't work.
Also, never delete, move or alter the sentinel lines in derived files written by the ``Tangle`` command.
Such lines start with the comment delimiter followed by a section name.

If you change the section name in a sentinel line ``Untangle`` will not update the code in the outline
(with the old name) that generated the renamed section.
``Untangle`` warns about sections that appear in a derived file but not in the outline.
``Untangle`` has no trouble with changed section references in derived files;
it is only changed sentinel lines that cause problems.

Cloned nodes that generate code in several files may cause problems for ``Untangle``.
If ``Untangle`` is run separately on these derived files,
``Untangle`` will update all cloned nodes each time it is run,
so only the code in the last Untangle run will take effect.
Therefore, the safe way to update text in cloned nodes is to make the change in the .leo file rather than the derived files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.50">The ``@verbose``, ``@terse``, ``@quiet`` and ``@silent`` directives determine
how the ``Tangle`` command outputs comments in ``@root`` trees.
Comments written by the user in code sections are always output.
These directives control only:
a) the comments containing doc sections and
b) sentinel comments that delimit the beginning and end of code sections.

When ``@verbose`` is in effect ``Tangle`` outputs all comments.
When ``@terse`` is in effect, ``Tangle`` outputs only those comments necessary for ``Untangle`` to work.
When ``@silent`` is in effect Tangle adds no additional comments.
The ``@quiet`` directive is like @silent except that it does output leading sentinels as comments.
Like ``@silent``, ``@quiet`` inhibits untangling. 
``@verbose`` is the default.
If more than one of these directives appear in the same body text the "most verbose" of these options will be in effect.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828061501.51">In most respects ``@thin`` works just like ``@file``.
In fact, you can convert from ``@file`` to ``@thin`` simply by opening an outline,
changing ``@file`` to ``@thin``, and saving the outline.

Here are the differences between ``@file`` and ``@thin``:

- Leo does not save the information contained in the ``@thin`` tree in the .leo file.  

- Files derived from ``@thin`` ("thin" derived files) contain all information needed to
  recreate the ``@thin`` tree in the outline.
  In particular, ``@+node`` and ``@-node`` sentinels use timestamps to uniquely identify nodes.

- The ``@all`` directive is valid only in ``@thin`` trees.

- Thin derived files are much more friendly to cvs than files derived from ``@file`` trees.
  Developers only need to commit thin derived files to cvs.

  The cvs repository contains **reference** .leo files.
  These reference files should containing nothing but ``@thin`` nodes.
  Reference files will change only when new derived files get added to the project.

  Developers will use local copies of reference files for their own work.
  For example, instead of using LeoPyRef.leo directly, I use a copy called ``LeoPy.leo``.
  My local copy can contain nodes other than ``@thin`` nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828062751">In the following table all terms in each row are equivalent.
The spelling in the first column is preferred:

You can get any combination of sentinels/no sentinels and references/no references using

Leo can not update the outline from changes made from derived files unless those files contain sentinels.
The primary source for ``@nosent`` and ``@asis`` trees are the outlines from which those files were derived.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828064254">The ``@others`` directive refers to the body text of all nodes *except* section definition nodes.
The ``@others`` directive places the body text of section definition nodes in the derived file in outline order.

An ``@file`` tree may contain more than one ``@others`` directive.
``@others`` directives that descend from other ``@others`` directives refer only to unnamed nodes that descend from them.
The ``@others`` directive that occurs highest in the ``@file`` tree refers to all other unnamed nodes.

**Notes**:

- No node may contain more than one ``@others`` directive.

- No section definition node may intervene between an non-section definition node containing body text and
  an ``@others`` node.
  In practice this is never a problem.

- The ``@others`` directive is not valid in ``@root`` or ``@unit`` trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828065955.3">The ``@ignore`` directive is valid *only* in the root node of ``@file`` trees.
The ``@ignore`` directive has several uses:

- In the root node of an ``@file`` tree, ``@ignore`` prevents Leo from writing the derived file.

- In ``@root`` trees, ``@ignore`` excludes the ``@ignore`` tree from the derived file.

- Outside of ``@file`` and ``@root`` trees, ``@ignore`` can be used by scripts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828103319">When writing `derived files`_, Leo stores information about the outline
structure in special comments called **sentinel lines**. Sentinel lines are
comment lines with '@' following the comment delimiter. For example, here are
some actual sentinel line for the derived file containing Python code::

    #@+leo-ver=4-thin
    #@+node:ekr.20031218072017.2794:@thin leoColor.py
    #@@language python
    #@@tabwidth -4
    #@@pagewidth 80
    #@-node:ekr.20031218072017.2794:@thin leoColor.py
    #@-leo

**You must not change sentinel lines** when editing a `derived file`_ in another
editor! Doing so will corrupt the derived file and make it impossible for Leo to
read it normally. If you do accidentally alter a sentinel line, don't panic!
Leo's ``Import Derived File`` command_ can recover information from corrupted
derived files.

The main difference between `@file`_ trees, `@thin`_ trees (and other kinds of trees that create derived files)
is the kind of sentinel lines that Leo writes:

- Sentinels in files derived from `@thin`_ reduce spurious cvs conflicts by
  marking each node with unique, unchanging **timestamp** as shown above.

- Sentinels in files derived from `@file`_ are as friendly as possible for human readers.

- Files derived from `@nosent`_ have no sentinels at all.
  **Important**: without sentinels Leo can not automatically update
  ``@nosent`` trees from changes made in external editors.

`Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo`_ discusses the various ways of creating derived files.
This is a highly complex subject: you should ignore these details at first.
Just use ``@thin`` to create your `derived files`_.</t>

saves the information in the `@thin`_ tree in the .leo file. No information is
lost; Leo will load the `@thin`_ tree from the .leo file the next time Leo
opens the .leo file.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828163557">You can create derived files using seven kinds of directives.
Unlike most directives, these directives may only appear in headlines.

The first five,
``@auto``, ``@file-thin``, ``@file``, ``@file-nosent``, ``@file-noref``, ``@file-asis``,
are collectively known as ``@file`` trees.
The abbreviated forms are most common:
``@thin``, ``@file``, ``@nosent``, ``@noref`` and ``@asis``.
There is also a sixth directive: ``@root``.

**Important**: You create the ``@file`` trees by putting
``@thin``, ``@file``, ``@nosent``, ``@noref`` or ``@asis`` (or the long forms) in a *headline*.
In contrast, you create ``@root`` trees by putting the ``root`` directive in *body text*.
The term 'directive' usually refers to a construct in Leo's body text.
In this chapter *I'll stretch the term* to include all 10 ``@file`` forms,
as well as the true ``@root`` directive.
Here are the six ways of creating derived files:
    
\@auto
  Import the derived file when Leo reads an outline.
  See `@auto`_ for full details.

\@thin
  Use this unless you have a good reason not to.
  It is the 'state-of-the-art' in derived files.
  This form is easy to use and is cvs friendly.
  Using ``@thin`` reduces the size of .leo files,
  and saves all essential information in the derived file.
  ``@all`` directives are valid only in ``@thin`` trees.

\@file
  This was the old 'state-of-the-art' directive.
  There is not much reason to use it now,
  except that its sentinels are more readable than ``@thin`` sentinels.
  However, ``@file`` is not nearly as cvs friendly as ``@thin``;
  avoid ``@file`` in cooperative environments.

\@nosent
  Use this directive only if you absolutely can not tolerate any sentinels in derived files.
  Without sentinels, Leo can not update ``@nosent`` trees from changes made to the derived files.
  *Consider using @thin even if you must produce derived files without sentinels*.
  You can use ``@thin`` for most work, then change ``@thin`` to ``@nosent``
  when showing your derived files to the world.
  
  **New in Leo 4.4.3**: The @bool force_newlines_in_at_nosent_bodies setting
  controls whether Leo writes a trailing newline if non-empty body text does not
  end in a newline. The default is True. In effect, the default value of this
  setting was False in previous versions of Leo.

\@noref
  This directive produces derived files with minimal sentinels.
  Section references are not allowed.
  This is the least often used way of producing derived files.
  Don't use this unless you are sure you must.

\@asis
  This directive copies body text verbatim,
  without even ensuring that newlines terminate each node.
  Use this directive only when you must have complete control over every character of the derived file.

\@root
  This directive is the most flexible, and the most difficult to use.
  **Note**: ``@root`` is a true directive: you put ``@root`` in body text.
  Historically, this was the first directive that created derived files.
  It comes closest in spirit to traditional literate programming tools.
  However, it is seldom necessary to suffer the drawbacks of using ``@root``.
  It is certainly never necessary when programming in Python.
  My advice is to avoid using ``@root`` unless you have a compelling reason.

To complicate matters further,
you can use `CWEB`_ markup instead of `noweb`_ markup.
See the section called `CWEB mode`_ for the details.
The choice between CWEB and noweb is independent of the directive is used to create derived files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828173234">The ``@`` directive starts a doc part.
Doc parts continue until an ``@c`` directive or the end of the body text.
For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

``@doc`` is a synonym for ``@``, but ``@`` is preferred.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828173234.1">The ``@c`` directive ends a doc part and begins a code part.
``@code`` is a synonym for ``@c``, but ``@c`` is preferred.

In ``@root`` and ``@unit`` trees, the headline must contain a valid section name.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828174453.1">Leo writes ``@nosent`` trees just as for ``@thin`` trees,
but Leo writes no sentinels at all.

**New in Leo 4.4.3**: The @bool force_newlines_in_at_nosent_bodies setting
controls whether Leo writes a trailing newline if non-empty body text does not
end in a newline. The default is True. In effect, the default value of this
setting was False in previous versions of Leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828174453.2">The only difference between ``@asis`` and ``@noref`` trees is that files derived from
``@noref`` contain sentinels while files derived from ``@asis`` do not.

Leo creates files derived from ``@noref`` and ``@asis`` trees by
writing the body text of all nodes of the tree in outline order.
Leo writes the body text *as is*, without recognizing section definitions,
without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way.
In particular, Leo copies all directives,
including ``@`` or ``@c`` directives, to the derived file as text.

Leo does recognize the ``@ignore`` directive in the *ancestors* of ``@noref`` or ``@asis`` nodes,
so you may use the ``@ignore`` directive as usual to prevent Leo from writing ``@noref`` or ``@asis`` trees.

**Notes**:

- When writing ``@noref`` trees,
  Leo writes only the ``@+leo``, ``@-leo``, ``@+node``, ``@-node``, ``@+body`` and ``@-body`` sentinels.

- Within ``@asis`` trees only, if a headline starts with ``@@``,
  Leo writes everything in the headline following the ``@@`` just before the corresponding body text.

- Files derived from ``@asis`` trees contain *nothing* not contained in body text (or ``@@`` headlines).
  In particular, if body text does not end in a newline,
  the first line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the preceding node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828205054">The following directives are commonly used by Leo programmers.
See `Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo`_ for full details.

- **@** Starts doc parts (and ends code parts).

- **@all** Copies *all* descendant nodes to the derived file.

- **@c** Starts code parts (and ends doc parts).

- **@encoding** Sets the Unicode encoding used in derived files.

- **@first** Forces lines to appear before the first sentinel of a derived file.
   
- **@language** Sets the language used for syntax coloring **and** sets the comment delimiters 
  used in sentinel lines and in doc parts.

- **@last** Forces lines to appear after the last sentinel of a derived file.

- **@lineending** Specifies the line ending to be used in derived files.

- **@others** Copies all nodes *except section definition nodes* to the derived file.

- **@pagewidth** Sets the page width used to break doc parts into lines.

- **@path** Sets the path to be prepended to filenames in descendant ``@file`` nodes.

**Important**:
Leo treats lines starting with ``@`` as a normal code line unless the ``@`` starts a Leo directive.
In particular, Leo will output Python decorators correctly, provided the name of the decorator is not a Leo directive.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828210721">The ``@last`` directive allows you to place lines at the very end of files derived from ``@file`` nodes.
The ``@last`` directive is recognized only at the end of body text of ``@file`` nodes.
No text may follow ``@last`` directives.
More than one ``@last`` directive may exist.
For example, here is how a PHP file might be set up::

	@first &lt;?php
	...
	@last ?&gt;</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828210721.1">The ``@pagewidth`` directive overrides the ``page_width`` setting.
The form of the ``@pagewidth`` directive is ``@pagewidth`` *n*,
where n is a positive integer that indicates the width of tangled pages in columns.
For example::

    @pagewidth 100

This setting only affects how Leo reformats doc parts, and how the ``Tangle`` command outputs block comments.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828210721.2">The ``@tabwidth`` directive overrides the ``tab_width`` setting.
The form of the ``@tabwidth`` directive is ``@tabwidth`` *n*,
where n is a positive integer that indicates the width of tabs in spaces.
For example::

    @tabwidth -4

Negative values cause Leo to convert tabs to blanks.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050828211507">Here is a brief summary of each directive:

- **\@**
  Starts a doc part. ``@doc`` is a deprecated synonym.

- **\@all**
  Copies *all* descendant nodes to the derived file.
  Not valid in ``@root`` trees.
  
- **\@auto**
  Imports the derived file every time Leo reads the outline.
  The read-at-auto-nodes and write-at-auto-nodes commands can
  be used to read and write and @auto nodes.

- **\@c**
  Starts a code part. ``@code`` is a deprecated synonym.

- **\@color**, **\@nocolor** and **\@killcolor**
  Control syntax coloring.

- **\@comment**
  Sets comment delimiters in ``@root`` and ``@unit`` trees.

- **\@delims**
  Sets comment delimiters in ``@file`` trees.

- **\@encoding**
  Sets the Unicode encoding used in derived files.

- **\@first**
  Forces lines to appear before the first sentinel of a derived file.

- **\@ignore**
  Causes Leo to ignore all or part of a derived file.
  Works differently in ``@file`` and ``@root`` trees.

- **\@language**
  Sets the language used for syntax coloring **and**
  sets the comment delimiters used in sentinel lines and in doc parts.

- **\@last**
  Forces lines to appear after the last sentinel of a derived file.

- **\@lineending**
  Sets the line ending to be used in derived files.

- **\@others**
  Copies all nodes *except* section definition nodes to the derived file.

- **\@pagewidth**
  Sets the page width used to break doc parts into lines.

- **\@path**
  Set the path to be appended to filenames.

- **\@raw** and **\@end_raw**
  Delimit a section of 'raw' text.
  Not valid in ``@root`` or ``@unit`` trees.

- **\@root**, **\@root-code** and **\@root-code**
  Start an ``@root`` tree.
  The last two forms set the starting mode for body text.

- **\@tabwidth**
  Sets the width of tabs.
  Negative tab widths cause Leo to convert tabs to spaces.

- **@verbose**, **@terse**, **@quiet** and **@silent**
  Set the verbosity of sentinels in files derived from ``@root``.

- **\@wrap** and **\@nowrap**
  Enable or disable line wrapping the Leo's body pane.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.7">The following sections give full details about each directive.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.8">The ``@`` directive starts a doc part.
Doc parts continue until an ``@c`` directive or the end of the body text.
For example::

    @ This is a comment in a doc part.
    Doc parts can span multiple lines.
    The next line ends the doc part
    @c

``@doc`` is a synonym for ``@``, but ``@`` is preferred.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.9">The ``@all`` directive is valid only in ``@thin`` trees.
The ``@all`` directive is similar to ``@others``, but it is less restrictive:
it dumps *all* nodes to the derived file, including ``@ignore`` nodes and nodes that
in an ``@others`` tree would be considered to be orphan nodes.

The ``@all`` directive is required for files such as ``@thin leoProjects.txt`` in ``LeoPy.leo``.
``leoProjects.txt`` contains so-called project nodes.
It doesn't have any meaning as a program file: it is simply a collection of unrelated data.
``@others`` would not work at all: it would complain about lots of orphan nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.10">The ``@c`` directive ends a doc part and begins a code part.
``@code`` is a synonym for ``@c``, but ``@c`` is preferred.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.11">Syntax coloring is on by default in all body text.
Leo formats comments and documentation parts in red,
directives and C keywords in blue,
strings and character constants in gray and all other text in code parts in black.
The ``@nocolor`` directive disables syntax coloring for the body text in which it appears.
No syntax coloring is done until an ``@color`` directive re-enables syntax coloring.

If a node contains neither the ``@color`` nor the ``@nocolor`` directive
it may inherit the syntax coloring attribute from an ancestor.
The nearest ancestor that contains exactly one of the ``@color`` or ``@nocolor`` directives
will control the syntax coloring.
**Ambiguous nodes**, nodes containing both the ``@color`` and ``@nocolor`` directives,
never affect the coloring of their offspring.

The ``@killcolor`` directive completely disables the colorizer for that node.
The result much faster syntax coloring of large body text.
As usual ``@killcolor`` may itself be overridden in descendant nodes.
The differences between ``@killcolor`` and ``@nocolor``:

- ``@nocolor`` suppresses coloring only until the next ``@color`` directive.

- ``@killcolor`` overrides ``@nocolor`` and ``@color`` directives.
  Any node containing @killcolor is unambiguously a ``@killcolor`` node regardless of
  whether that node also contains ``@color`` or ``@nocolor`` directives.

**Note**:
the ``@color``, ``@nocolor`` and ``@killcolor`` directives do not affect the ``Tangle`` commands in any way.
In particular, the ``Tangle`` commands will recognize section definitions as usual even
after an ``@nocolor`` directive is seen.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.12">**Note**:
the ``@comment`` directive is deprecated:
you should use the ``@language`` directive whenever possible.
However, sometimes using both ``@language`` and ``@comment`` is useful.
For this to be effective the ``@comment`` directive should appear after the ``@language`` directive (in outline order).

The ``Untangle`` command will not process an ``@root`` or ``@unit`` node if
an ``@comment`` directive is in effect because
``Untangle`` can't be sure of properly parsing a derived file if the language of the derived file isn't known.
It might be possible to assume some defaults in this case,
but that is not done at present and is not a high priority.
By default, the ``Tangle`` commands produces C-language comments.
Single-line comments generated during tangling start with ``///``,
while documentation parts are surrounded by ``/*`` and ``*/``.
The ``@comment`` directive allows you to use ``Tangle`` to produce shell and make files,
as well as source code for other programming languages.

The ``@comment`` directive may be followed by zero to three delimiters, separated by whitespace.
This directive sets the single-line comment delimiter and the opening and closing block comment delimiters as follows:

====================== =====================================================================
\@comment              no args\: restores the defaults to ///, /\* and \*/
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment ///          \1 arg\: sets the single-line comment and clears the other delims.
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment /\* \*/      \2 args\: sets the block comment delims; clears the single-line delim.
---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\@comment /// /\* \*/  \3 args\: sets all three delimiters.
====================== =====================================================================

If only one delimiter is given, Leo does not write any documentation parts while tangling.
If two delimiters are given, block-style comments are used instead of single-line comments.
For example, the ``@comment { }`` directive could be used to tangle Pascal files.

The ``@comment`` directive is only recognized in ``@root``, ``@unit`` or ``@file`` nodes,
and the ``@comment`` directive must precede the first section name or ``@code`` directive.
An ``@comment`` directive in the body text of an ``@unit`` directive specifies the current global defaults.
An ``@comment`` directive in the body text of an ``@root`` directive affects comments generated for one root only.
Comments in all other roots are governed by the global defaults.

Leo will convert underscores in the ``@comment`` directives to significant spaces.  For example::

    @comment REM_

causes the comment delimiter to be "REM " (Note the trailing space).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.13">The ``@delims`` directive changes the comment strings used to mark sentinel lines.
This directive is often used to place Javascript text inside XML or HTML files.

The ``@delims`` directive contains one or two delimiters, separated by whitespace.
If only one delim is present it delimits single-line comments.
If two delims are present they delimit block comments.
The ``@delims`` directive can not be used to change the comment strings at the start of the derived file,
that is, the comment strings for the ``@+leo`` sentinel and the initial ``@+body`` and ``@+node`` sentinels.

The ``@delims`` directive inserts ``@@delims`` sentinels into the derived file.
The new delimiter strings continue in effect until the next ``@@delims`` sentinel in the derived file or
the end of the derived file.

**Note**: Leo can not revert to previous delimiters automatically;
you must change back to previous delimiters using another ``@delims`` directive. For example::

    @delims /* */
    Javascript stuff
    @delims &lt;-- --&gt;
    HTML stuff

Adding, deleting or changing ``@@delims`` sentinels will destroy Leo's ability to read the derived file.
Mistakes using the ``@delims`` directive have no effect on Leo,
though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a derived file as far as compilers,
HTML renderers, etc. are concerned.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.14">You may use the ``@encoding`` directive to specify the encoding used in a derived file.
You can't mix encodings in a single derived file.  For example::

    @encoding iso-8859-1

If the encoding used in a derived file is not "utf-8" it is represented in the @+leo sentinel line, like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

The ``utf-8`` encoding is used by default.
The ``utf-8`` encoding is a "lossless" encoding (it can represent all unicode code points),
so encoding and decoding to and from ``utf-8`` plain strings will never cause a problem.
When reading or writing a character not in a "lossy" encoding (such as ``iso-8859-1``),
Leo converts such characters to ``'?'`` and issues a warning. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.15">The ``@first`` directive allows you to place lines at the very start of files derived from ``@file`` nodes.
For example, the body text of ``@file spam.py`` might be::

	@first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of ``@file foo.perl`` might be::

	@first #/usr/bin/perl

``@first`` directives are recognized only at the start of the body text of ``@file`` nodes.
No text may precede ``@first`` directives.
More than one ``@first`` directive may exist, like this::

	@first #! /usr/bin/env python
	@first # more comments.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.16">The ``@ignore`` directive is valid *only* in the root node of ``@file`` trees.
The ``@ignore`` directive has several uses:

- In the root node of an ``@file`` tree, ``@ignore`` prevents Leo from writing the derived file.

- In ``@root`` trees, ``@ignore`` excludes the ``@ignore`` tree from the derived file.

- Outside of ``@file`` and ``@root`` trees, ``@ignore`` can be used by scripts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.17">The ``@language`` directive specifies the comment delimiters and string types used by the
``Tangle`` and ``Untangle`` commands.
This directive over-rides the default specified in the settings dialog.
Here are the valid ``@language`` directives::

    @language actionscript
    @language c
    @language c++
    @language cweb
    @language elisp
    @language html
    @language java
    @language latex
    @language objective-c
    @language pascal
    @language perl
    @language perlpod
    @language plain
    @language python
    @language rebol
    @language shell
    @language tcltk

Shell files have comments that start with `#`.
Case is ignored in the language specifiers, but not in the ``@language`` itself.
Thus, the following are equivalent::

    @language html
    @language HTML
    @language hTmL

but the following is invalid::

    @LANGUAGE html</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.18">The ``@last`` directive allows you to place lines at the very end of files derived from ``@file`` nodes.
The ``@last`` directive is recognized only at the end of body text of ``@file`` nodes.
No text may follow ``@last`` directives.
More than one ``@last`` directive may exist.
For example, here is how a PHP file might be set up::

	@first &lt;?php
	...
	@last ?&gt;</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.19">The ``@lineending`` directive sets the line endings for individual derived files.
This directive will override the ``output_newline`` setting.
The ``@lineending`` *never* affects the line endings in .leo files themselves:
.leo files must have consistent line endings!

The valid forms of the ``@lineending`` directive are:

======================= ======================================================
\@lineending nl         The default, Linux.
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending cr         Mac
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending crlf       Windows
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending lf         Same as 'nl', not recommended
----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
\@lineending platform   Same as platform value for ``output_newline`` setting.
======================= ======================================================</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.20">The ``@others`` directive refers to the body text of all nodes *except* section definition nodes.
The ``@others`` directive places the body text of section definition nodes in the derived file in outline order.

An ``@file`` tree may contain more than one ``@others`` directive.
``@others`` directives that descend from other ``@others`` directives refer only to unnamed nodes that descend from them.
The ``@others`` directive that occurs highest in the ``@file`` tree refers to all other unnamed nodes.

**Notes**:

- No node may contain more than one ``@others`` directive.

- No section definition node may intervene between an non-section definition node containing body text and
  an ``@others`` node.
  In practice this is never a problem.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.21">The ``@path`` directives override the deprecated ``default_tangle_directory`` setting.

The form of the @path directive is ``@path`` *filename*,
where *filename* is taken to be everything following @path to the end of the line.

If *filename* is an absolute filename the location of the derived file is specified only by the filename.
Otherwise, if *filename* is a relative filename, the location of the derived file is relative to:
	
1. the directory specified the applicable ``@path`` directive, or
2. the "Default Tangle Directory" in the Settings dialog if no ``@path`` directive is in effect, or
3. the directory in which the .leo resides if the .leo file has ever been saved.

An error occurs if no absolute path can be computed according to these rules,
or if *filename* does not exist.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.22">The ``@pagewidth`` directive overrides the ``page_width`` setting.
The form of the ``@pagewidth`` directive is ``@pagewidth`` *n*,
where n is a positive integer that indicates the width of tangled pages in columns.
For example::

    @pagewidth 100

This setting only affects how Leo reformats doc parts, and how the ``Tangle`` command outputs block comments.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.23">The ``@tabwidth`` directive overrides the ``tab_width`` setting.
The form of the ``@tabwidth`` directive is ``@tabwidth`` *n*,
where n is a positive integer that indicates the width of tabs in spaces.
For example::

    @tabwidth -4

Negative values cause Leo to convert tabs to blanks.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.24">The ``@raw`` and ``@end_raw`` directives are valid only within ``@file`` trees.
The ``@raw`` directive starts a section of "raw" text.
The ``@end_raw`` directive ends such a section, as does the end of body text.
No section references are recognized within raw text,
and no additional leading whitespace is generated within raw text when writing the derived file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.25">Leo allows you to choose whether body text in ``@root`` trees will start in code mode or doc mode by default.
``@root-doc`` *filename* and ``@root-code`` *filename* directives
specify that body text is assumed to start in doc mode or code mode respectively.
The options (``-doc`` and ``-code``) must follow ``@root`` immediately with no intervening whitespace.
In effect, ``@root-code`` and ``@root-doc`` are two new directives.

These ``@root`` options override the ``at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode`` setting.
This setting affects only @root trees without options.
Such "plain" ``@root`` trees are now deprecated,
which only means that it is better style to use either ``@root-code`` or ``@root-doc``.
The reason is simple:
the meaning of plain ``@root`` trees will depend on the ``at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode`` setting.
It's better to be explicit.
By default, ``at_root_bodies_start_in_doc_mode = 1`` for compatibility for old ``@root`` trees.
I actually don't think this option is good for much;
I created it before I created ``@root-doc`` and ``@root-code`` settings,
and I decided it wouldn't hurt to leave it in.
Anyway, you now have complete flexibility about how ``@root`` works,
and in particular you can make ``@root`` work just like ``@file``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.26">The ``@verbose``, ``@terse``, ``@quiet`` and ``@silent`` directives determine
how the ``Tangle`` command outputs comments in ``@root`` trees.
Comments written by the user in code sections are always output.
These directives control only:
a) the comments containing doc sections and
b) sentinel comments that delimit the beginning and end of code sections.

When ``@verbose`` is in effect ``Tangle`` outputs all comments.
When ``@terse`` is in effect, ``Tangle`` outputs only those comments necessary for ``Untangle`` to work.
When ``@silent`` is in effect Tangle adds no additional comments.
The ``@quiet`` directive is like @silent except that it does output leading sentinels as comments.
Like ``@silent``, ``@quiet`` inhibits untangling. 
``@verbose`` is the default.
If more than one of these directives appear in the same body text the "most verbose" of these options will be in effect.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.27">By default, the ``body_pane_wraps`` setting controls whether body text wraps.
You may override this setting for a particular tree using the ``@wrap`` and ``@nowrap`` directives.
Only the first ``@wrap`` or ``@nowrap`` directive in a node has any effect.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.28">In the following table all terms in each row are equivalent.
The spelling in the first column is preferred:

=========== =============== =================
\@asis      \@file-asis     \@silent
----------- --------------- -----------------
\@nosent    \@file-nosent   \@nosentinelsfile
----------- --------------- -----------------
\@noref     \@file-noref    \@rawfile
=========== =============== =================

You can get any combination of sentinels/no sentinels and references/no references using
``@file``, ``@nosent``, ``@noref`` and ``@asis`` trees:

+---------+------------+-------------------+
|         |            | Sections and      |
| Type    | Sentinels? | @others expanded? |
+---------+------------+-------------------+

+---------+------------+-------------------+
| @nosent | no         | yes               |
+---------+------------+-------------------+

Leo can not update the outline from changes made from derived files unless those files contain sentinels.
The primary source for ``@nosent`` and ``@asis`` trees are the outlines from which those files were derived.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.29">In most respects ``@thin`` works just like ``@file``.
In fact, you can convert from ``@file`` to ``@thin`` simply by opening an outline,
changing ``@file`` to ``@thin``, and saving the outline.

Here are the differences between ``@file`` and ``@thin``:

- Leo does not save the information contained in the ``@thin`` tree in the .leo file.  

- Files derived from ``@thin`` ("thin" derived files) contain all information needed to
  recreate the ``@thin`` tree in the outline.
  In particular, ``@+node`` and ``@-node`` sentinels use timestamps to uniquely identify nodes.

- The ``@all`` directive is valid only in ``@thin`` trees.

- Thin derived files are much more friendly to cvs than files derived from ``@file`` trees.
  Developers only need to commit thin derived files to cvs.

  The cvs repository contains **reference** .leo files.
  These reference files should containing nothing but ``@thin`` nodes.
  Reference files will change only when new derived files get added to the project.

  Developers will use local copies of reference files for their own work.
  For example, instead of using LeoPyRef.leo directly, I use a copy called ``LeoPy.leo``.
  My local copy can contain nodes other than ``@thin`` nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.30">Leo writes ``@nosent`` trees just as for ``@thin`` trees,
but Leo writes no sentinels at all.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.31">The only difference between ``@asis`` and ``@noref`` trees is that files derived from
``@noref`` contain sentinels while files derived from ``@asis`` do not.

Leo creates files derived from ``@noref`` and ``@asis`` trees by
writing the body text of all nodes of the tree in outline order.
Leo writes the body text *as is*, without recognizing section definitions,
without expanding section references, and without treating directives specially in any way.
In particular, Leo copies all directives,
including ``@`` or ``@c`` directives, to the derived file as text.

Leo does recognize the ``@ignore`` directive in the *ancestors* of ``@noref`` or ``@asis`` nodes,
so you may use the ``@ignore`` directive as usual to prevent Leo from writing ``@noref`` or ``@asis`` trees.

**Notes**:

- When writing ``@noref`` trees,
  Leo writes only the ``@+leo``, ``@-leo``, ``@+node``, ``@-node``, ``@+body`` and ``@-body`` sentinels.

- Within ``@asis`` trees only, if a headline starts with ``@@``,
  Leo writes everything in the headline following the ``@@`` just before the corresponding body text.

- Files derived from ``@asis`` trees contain *nothing* not contained in body text (or ``@@`` headlines).
  In particular, if body text does not end in a newline,
  the first line from the next node will concatenated to the last line of the preceding node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.32">This section discusses all aspects of ``@root`` trees.
You should carefully consider whether the extra flexibility afforded by
``@root`` trees is worth the extra bother.
Indeed, ``@file`` trees are much easier to use than ``@root`` trees:

- ``@file`` trees use less markup than ``@root`` trees.
  In particular, the @others directive is valid only within ``@file`` trees.

- You must explicitly tangle and untangle ``@root`` trees using the ``Tangle`` and ``Untangle`` commands.

However, ``@root`` trees are more flexible than ``@file`` trees:

- Sections may be defined anywhere within ``@root`` trees.
  Moreover, the ``@unit`` directive expands the scope of section definitions in ``@root`` trees
  so that a section may be referenced in several ``@root`` trees.

- The meaning of section definitions in ``@root`` trees are independent of their position within the tree.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.33">Just as with ``@file`` trees, ``@root`` trees may contain code parts and doc parts.
Code parts start with section definition lines (see below) or the ``@c`` directive.
Doc parts start with ``@`` directive.
Doc parts continue until the end of body text or until the next ``@c`` or ``@`` directive.

Body text in ``@root`` trees contain zero or more code and doc parts in any order.
The ``@c`` directive starts a named code section if the node's headline starts with::

    &lt;&lt; section name &gt;&gt;

Otherwise, the ``@c`` directive is invalid.

**Section definition lines** are lines of the form::

	&lt;&lt; section name &gt;&gt;=

(note the equal sign).
Such lines also start named code parts.
Named code parts in ``@root`` trees may be defined in several places.
The definition of a named code part is the concatenation of all code parts with the same name.
Body text that defines no code part is ignored.
At least one non-blank line must follow the section definition line;
empty sections are not allowed.

**Note for pdf version**:
due to a bug in docutils the phrase 'double-angle-bracket characters' below stands for::

    &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;

As in ``@file`` trees, paired double-angle-bracket characters on the same line always denote a section name,
even within comments are strings.
Thus,double-angle-bracket characters that do not delimit a section name must be placed on separate lines.
If double-angle-bracket are not paired on a line, they are treated as ordinary double-angle-bracket characters.

Here is a typical example of body text within an @root tree::

    @ This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    &lt;&lt;atFile methods&gt;&gt;=
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)

Provided that the node's headline starts with::

    &lt;&lt; atFile methods &gt;&gt;

the example above is equivalent to::

    @ This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    @c
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)

We may not eliminate @c directives in @root trees.
If we convert the doc part to a comment we are left with::

    @c
    # This method puts an open node sentinel for node v.
    def putOpenNodeSentinel(self,v):
        if v.isAtFileNode() and v != self.root:
            &lt;&lt; issue an error message &gt;&gt;
        else:
            s = self.nodeSentinelText(v)
            self.putSentinel("@+node:" + s)
    
The following escape convention applies only in ``@root`` trees.
Within a code parts ``@@`` in the first column (and only in the first column) stands for a single ``@`` sign.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.34">Each ``@root`` tree represents a single derived file.
**Tangling** is the process of creating derived files from ``@file`` or ``@root`` trees.
Leo tangles ``@file`` trees automatically whenever an outline is saved.
The user must tangle ``@root`` trees explicitly using one of the ``Tangle`` commands.

Leo creates derived files by expanding all section references in an ``@root`` node.
Leo expands a section reference by substituting the code section itself for the section reference.
This is a recursive process:
the substituted code section may contain other code references which are themselves expanded, and so on.

It is unusual and bad style for the meaning of an ``@root`` tree to depend on the position of nodes within it.
The meaning of a section definition in an ``@root`` tree usually does not depend on is position,
and we may place sections wherever we want.
The outline provides a natural way of organizing an sections as follows::

	Place the definition of a section S in a child of
	the node containing the reference to S.

If a section is referenced in more than one node,
I usually place its definition in a node containing all the nodes that refer to it.
Using this rule of thumb creates an outline whose structure mirrors the intrinsic organization of a program.

The ``Tangle`` command creates derived files from ``@root`` node.
The ``@root`` directive indicates which sections constitute an output file.
The text following a @root directive forms the entire content of the file,
that is, after section references are expanded.
An outline can contain arbitrarily many ``@root`` directives:
Leo's ``Tangle`` commands will create one output file for each.
The process of creating derived files is called "tangling" because
the code from the outline is rearrange to create the derived files.

For example, the following ``@root`` section shows a typical way of specifying a header file ``xx.h``::

    @root xx.h
    #ifndef xx_defined
    #define xx_defined
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public constants of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public types of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; declarations of public variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; public prototypes of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    #endif

The ``Tangle`` commands will create the file ``xx.h`` from this body text by expanding all the section references.
Incidentally, the introductory documentation will be included in the header file:
any text preceding the ``@root`` directive is treated just like the documentation part of an section definition.

As another example, the following shows a typical way of specifying the corresponding ``xx.c`` file::

    @root xx.c
    &lt;&lt; public variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private types of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private variables of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; private function prototypes of the xx class &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; methods of the xx class &gt;&gt;

There are three menu commands that tangle an outline: ``Tangle``, ``Tangle All`` and ``Tangle Marked``.
These commands are identical except for how much of the outline is tangled.
The ``Tangle`` command tangles only the selected portion of the outline,
the ``Tangle All`` command tangles the entire outline,
and the ``Tangle Marked`` command tangles only marked headlines.

The ``@root`` directive has three forms.
All three forms mean exactly the same thing::

    @root filename
    @root "filename"
    @root &lt;filename&gt;

If *filename* is an absolute filename the location of the derived file is specified only by the filename.
Otherwise, if the ``@root`` node contains a relative filename, the location of the derived file is relative to:
	
1. the directory specified by an ``@path`` directive, or

2. the ``default_tangle_directory`` setting if no ``@path`` directive is in effect, or

3. the directory in which the .leo resides if the .leo file has ever been saved.

An error occurs if no absolute path can be computed according to these rules,
or if the filename or directory does not exist.

The scope of a definition is the tree in which the definition is known.
By default, ``Tangle`` commands look for section definitions only
in the suboutline of the ``@root`` node being tangled.
That is, all sections are assumed to be defined either in the body text of the headline,
say h, containing the ``@root`` directive, or in the body texts of the descendants of h.
The ``@unit`` directive explicitly indicates the scope of section definitions.
When a ``Tangle`` command encounters the ``@unit`` directive it treats the suboutline containing
the ``@unit`` command as the scope for all enclosed roots.
This ensures that the group of roots in the subtree use the same section definitions.

For example, suppose we have a tree organized as follows::

	+ @unit
		+ @root A
		    sections in A
		+ @root B
		    sections in B
		
The ``@unit`` directive insures that
only sections defined in the unit can effect files A and B and
that all sections definitions in A and B are compatible with each other.

The ``Tangle`` commands ignore any tree containing an ``@ignore`` directive.
This ensures that trees that contain cloned nodes or other subsidiary information
do not cause the tangle commands to issue spurious error messages.
It also ensures that a tree can never contribute a section definition to another part of the outline by mistake.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.35">The ``Untangle``, ``Untangle All`` and ``Untangle Marked`` commands are the
reverse of the corresponding ``Tangle`` commands.
They update one or more ``@root`` nodes based on changes made to the corresponding derived files.

For example, suppose you create a new part of the outline and tangle it for the first time.
When you compile derived files for the first you are likely to get many syntax errors.
You could fix those errors in the outline and tangle the outline again, but there is a much easier way:
you fix the errors in the derived files using the compiler's editor,
then run the untangle command on the part of the outline that created the derived file.
The ``Untangle`` command updates the selected outline to match the changes in the derived files.
It's as simple as that.
By the way, the ``Untangle`` command marks all the nodes in the outline that it updates,
and you can examine all such nodes with the ``Go To Next Marked`` command in the ``Outline`` menu.

You cannot use ``Untangle`` to update doc parts, or leading comments in code parts or
"trivial" whitespace in code parts.
This is a limitation of the ``Untangle`` command that cannot be fixed;
``Untangle`` has no way of knowing whether leading comments came from doc parts or are just leading comments.

``Untangle`` never changes the structure of an outline;
it never inserts, deletes or moves nodes.
Don't attempt to change the structure of an outline by modifying derived files; it won't work.
Also, never delete, move or alter the sentinel lines in derived files written by the ``Tangle`` command.
Such lines start with the comment delimiter followed by a section name.

If you change the section name in a sentinel line ``Untangle`` will not update the code in the outline
(with the old name) that generated the renamed section.
``Untangle`` warns about sections that appear in a derived file but not in the outline.
``Untangle`` has no trouble with changed section references in derived files;
it is only changed sentinel lines that cause problems.

Cloned nodes that generate code in several files may cause problems for ``Untangle``.
If ``Untangle`` is run separately on these derived files,
``Untangle`` will update all cloned nodes each time it is run,
so only the code in the last Untangle run will take effect.
Therefore, the safe way to update text in cloned nodes is to make the change in the .leo file rather than the derived files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050829134901.36">Cweb mode refers to how Leo tangles an outline when ``@language cweb`` is in effect or
the ``cweb`` setting is in effect.
Leo treats *all* cweb code in cweb mode as unevaluated text.
That is, Leo treats cweb control codes, including::

    @&lt;...@&gt;
    @&lt;..@&gt;=
    @c
    @
    @*
    @

as "raw" text within cweb mode.

Leo does *not* expand *cweb* section references when writing derived files in cweb mode.
However, Leo *does* expand *noweb* section references,
so you may use noweb sections to organize cweb files!
You can create *noweb* code and doc sections using the ``@code`` and ``@doc`` directives
in place of ``@c`` and ``@`` directives.

By default, cweb colors ``@``, ``@*`` and ``@**`` sections using the same syntax coloring as for ``LaTeX``.
In addition, cweb colors ``C`` ``//`` and ``/*..*/`` comments using ``LaTeX`` coloring by default.
You may change these defaults using the

<t tx="ekr.20050829140911">Cweb mode refers to how Leo tangles an outline when ``@language cweb`` is in effect or
the ``cweb`` setting is in effect.
Leo treats *all* cweb code in cweb mode as unevaluated text.
That is, Leo treats cweb control codes, including:
``@&lt;...@&gt;``, ``@&lt;..@&gt;=``, ``@c``, ``@``, ``@*`` and ``@**`` as "raw" text within cweb mode.
Leo does *not* expand *cweb* section references when writing derived files in cweb mode.
However, Leo *does* expand *noweb* section references,
so you may use noweb sections to organize cweb files!
You can create *noweb* code and doc sections using the ``@code`` and ``@doc`` directives
in place of ``@c`` and ``@`` directives.

By default, cweb colors ``@``, ``@*`` and ``@**`` sections using the same syntax coloring as for ``LaTeX``.
In addition, cweb colors ``C`` ``//`` and ``/*..*/`` comments using ``LaTeX`` coloring by default.

.. contents::
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.1">"I am using Leo since a few weeks and I brim over with enthusiasm for it.
I think it is the most amazing software since the invention of the spreadsheet."

"We who use Leo know that it is a breakthrough tool and a whole new way of writing code." -- Joe Orr

"I am a huge fan of Leo.
I think it's quite possibly the most revolutionary programming tool I have ever used and it (along with the Python language) has utterly changed my view of programming (indeed of writing) forever." -- Shakeeb Alireza

"Thank you very much for Leo.
I think my way of working with data will change forever...
I am certain [Leo] will be a revolution.
The revolution is as important as the change from sequential linear organization of a book into
a web-like hyperlinked pages.
The main concept that impress me is that the source listing isn't the main focus any more.
You focus on the non-linear, hierarchical, collapsible outline of the source code." -- Korakot Chaovavanich

"Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage and
how much information I can find and organize and store in a useful way." -- Dan Winkler

"Wow, wow, and wow...I finally understand how to use clones and I realized that this is exactly how I want to organize my information.
Multiple views on my data, fully interlinkable just like my thoughts." -- Anon

"Edward... you've come up with perhaps the most powerful new concept
in code manipulation since VI and Emacs. -- David McNab

"Leo is...a revolutionary step in the right direction for programming." -- Brian Takita</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.2">"Thanks for a wonderful program – everybody should be using it! It blows the
socks off that Java Mind mapping software that won project of the month a while
back on sourceforge!" -- Derick van Niekerk.

"A few years back I would have said Zope was #1 Python showcase,
but I agree 100% that Leo is tops now." -- Jason Cunliffe

"Leo is the most interesting Python project I know of...I see lots of stuff posted on the Daily Python page, but I usually yawn and come over to this forum to see what's cooking." -- Anon

"Leo is the best Tkinter application ever written.
It convinces me that Tkinter can really *do something*, and do [it] well." - Anon

"What an original synthesis of different ideas,
why can't other Open Source projects change the way I think?" -- Anon</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.3">"When first I opened Leo, it was out of curiosity. But having used it...I'll never go back.  They'll have to pry Leo out of my cold, dead fingers!  Seriously, it should be renamed 'Crack Cocaine' because it's that addictive. I'm ready to start a 12-Step group." -- Travers A. Hough

"I feel addicted to programming again...in fact [Leo] has resurrected a dead project of mine :) The Outline has proven most liberating in terms of testing ideas out." -- Anon

"I have been absolutely seduced by Leo over the past few days. I tell you, I can not put it down. I feel like a kid with a shiny new bike...I'm already bursting with new ways I'd like to use the tool in the future." -- Lyn Adams Headley

Thanks for the great work--I love Leo!!! -- Josef Dalcolmo

Leo has simplified updating and creating new scripts and .bats keeping similar information in the same place. there is almost an addictive withdrawal effect when I can complete an operation in so much less time with Leo &amp; python than I had become used to. -- Anon</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.4">"[Leo] should either replace or greatly augment the development tools that I use." -- Zak Greant

"Leo is a marriage of outlining and literate programming. Pure genius. The main reason I am impressed with this tool is that it doesn't affect your choice of tools. You can use whatever IDE for whatever language and switch back and forth between Leo and it." -- Austin King

"Leo is the best IDE that I have had the pleasure to use. I have been using it now for about 2--3 months. It has totally changed not only the way that I program, but also the way that I store and organize all of the information that I need for the job that I do." -- Ian Mulvany

"I only have one week of Leo experience but I already know it will be my default IDE/project manager...people complain about the lack of a project manager for the free/standard Python IDE's like Idle. Leo clearly solves that problem and in a way that commercial tools can't touch." -- Marshall Parsons

"I have been using Leo for about 3 weeks and I hardly use my other programming editor anymore...I find it easy and enjoyable to use. I plan to adopt it as my presentation tool for code reviews." -- Jim Vickroy

"I'm absolutely astounded by the power of such a simple idea! It works great and I can immediately see the benefits of using Leo in place of the standard flat file editor." -- Tom Lee

I think you're really showing what open source can do and your current trajectory puts you on track to kick Emacs into the dustbin of computing history. -- Dan Winkler
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.5">"Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy."
--Joe Orr

"Leo is an interactive editor for organizing text fragments hierarchically and
sequentially into one or more files and hierarchical folders, without arbitrary
limits on the number and size of text fragments and the depth of the
hierarchy...Tangle is a tool for combining hierarchically and sequentially
organized text fragments into text files, hierarchically grouped into folders,
with hierarchical or sequential organization of text within the files, and
without arbitrary limits on the size and number of files and the depth of the
hierarchy of folders and text nesting within the files." -- Alex Abacus

"Leo reminds me a great deal of things I loved when I used Userland's Frontier
(an outlining cms with a native oodb) - but Frontier wasn't hackable enough for
me, and it wasn't oriented towards coding and literate programming, and you
couldn't round-trip rendered pages (big Leo win). This is really a super tool -
in a matter of days I've started to use it on all my projects and I still
haven't figured out how I lived without it." -- John Sequeira

"Leo is EXACTLY the kind of outliner I was looking for--fantastic job!"
-- Steve Allen

"If you are like me, you have a kind of knowledge base with infos gathered over
time. And you have projects, where you use some of those infos. Now, with
conventional outliners you begin to double these infos, because you want to have
the infos needed for the project with your project. With Leo you can do this
too, but if you change text in one place IT IS UPDATED IN THE OTHER PLACE TOO!
This is a feature I did not see with any other outliner (and I tried a few).
Amazing! Leo directly supports the way I work!" -- F. Geiger
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.6">"Another day, another breakthrough using Leo--now I realize Leo is the best URL bookmark manager there is. No more bookmarks menus or favorites lists inside the browser for me. With the @url directive I can just double click on the URL to open it in my browser. Leo lets me arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites. It's sooo much better than anything the browsers have built in and it lets me easily use different browsers on different platforms and different machines (try that with the browsers' built-in bookmark managers)." -- Dan Winkler

"I am an amateur photographer. I use plain old 35mm. film for my pictures. Over the weekend, I used Leo to organize my lists of pictures. It is quite helpful--I can have separate nodes for pictures I have enlarged, as well as pictures I have submitted to our local camera club. Thanks!" -- Rich Reis

"Cloning is pure genius!... Leo's cloning facility, allows me to create several views on the CFA course material. My main view follows the prescribed study guide. Another view is organized like the textbooks. Yet another gives me a glossary of terms. And when I'm done, I'll have some nice libraries...I can re-use later in other projects." -- Michael Manti</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.7">"I've tried Literate Programming tools off and on for more than 10 years, mainly because the promise was so great. I've abandoned them every time because working with the various Cweb-like tools was so awkward. Leo changes all that. The most important benefits promised by Literate Programming are realized by using Leo, without the awkwardness of the other tools." -- Dave Hein

"[Leo] has enabled me to use Literate Programming in production for the first time. When I figured out I could do it in plain text and export to DocBook for automated typesetting, I was on my way. Because I only do business and utility software, I don't need the sophistication of LaTeX markup. Writing the documentation and the code in the same outline at the same time improves the whole product. Being able to automatically export both with just two key presses (tangle and export-to-DocBook) is a real luxury." -- Michael Dawson

I wanted to thank you for the effort you've put into Leo.  It looks fantastic.  I've always though that Literate Programming was a good idea, but the tools were completely un-workable. -- Bob Hustead</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.8">"I've written documentation in WordPerfert, Ventura, Word, PageMaker, and FrameMaker and even though they create wonderfully looking and useful documents, they've never been able to do what I've been looking for. HTML, compiled help files, and later PDF came closer, but still not there...I think I've found it in LEO, a way to make a "living" document. A document built out of discrete parts that can be re-organized on the fly to meet the needs of a varying audience...I've already started converting the IT Procedures manual from Open Office to LEO because I know it's going to be much more useful to me and anyone else...just the possibility of keeping system maintenance scripts in the IT manual is mind boggling." -- David Nichols

"With the help of the rst2 plugin, [Leo is] the best outliner I have yet encountered for writing the early stages of academic papers."

"A Leo file is an ideal documentation tool, collecting the assorted readme.txt files, the comments from the source files...as well as the config files themselves." -- Kent Tenney</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.9">"Just as structured programming reveals and disciplines the flow control of a program, [Leo] allows the designer to reveal and discipline structure at many layers simultaneously: data structures, object structure, entity-relationship structure, client-server structure, design pattern structure, temporal structure, project management structure, and any other structure relevant to the system." -- Steven P. Schaefer

"A funny observation with Leo is that when I 'Leo-ise' other people's code, Leo makes the code's structure so transparent that design faults become very quickly apparent. For example, maintenance pain caused by lack of factorization." -- David McNab

"Leo is a powerful tool for organizing text into tree structures, and for just generally attacking a number of problems from a tree-based perspective." -- Joe Orr

"I found this blog entry by someone (a talented former coworker of mine actually) complaining about some poorly written code she had to maintain:
http://snippy.ceejbot.com/wiki/show/start/2003/01/29/001
She said: 'You'd need a bulldozer to start refactoring it.' That was my cue to write a long message explaining that there is indeed such a bulldozer and it's called Leo. (You can see my message there as a reply to her original posting.) I gave her my recipe for how to get someone else's messy, scary code into Leo and how to break it down into manageable chunks." -- Dan Winkler

"Ed, you continue to push the envelope. The amazing thing is that the footprint isn't doubling every few months like it would be in another designer's hands. Adding features by removing constraints, hot refactoring while adding unit tests. Forget the book. I would pay to see the movie."</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.10">"I am extremely impressed at how stable and useful Leo appears to be." -- Marcus A. Martin

"Leo is amazingly stable. Docs are often weak with Open Source Software. Not so Leo: Leo is unusually well documented." -- F. Geiger

"Leo is unimaginably useful and I always find new things it already knows(!) how to do. Indeed I am amazed by the never-ending resources and patience Edward is putting into it and its users community. Excellent." -- Gil Shwartz

"I feel strongly that Ed Ream, our ever-patient, ever-productive Leo architect deserves a nomination [ for the ActiveState OpenSource Award] Among other reasons, for:

- Delivering the first usable visual literate programming tool.
- Adding a vast abundance of new features.
- Making possible a previously unimaginable amount of leverage in code editing.
- Eliminating vast amounts of menial programming labour.
- Tirelessly and patiently supporting users, and catering to a wide range of feature requests."  -- David McNab

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.12">September 3, 2002

Hello, my full name is David Speed Ream. I am known as Speed to friends and enemies alike, but I gladly answer to David or most any other handle. I am an unabashed and biased fan of Leo, the fact that it was written by my brother Edward only slightly coloring my already colored glasses. I have been testing and using Leo in software production for over 4 years. My company currently has over 50,000 lines of code in over 100 source files that are written using Leo.

My comments are from two points of view, the first being software project manager for a complicated, multi-module software product, and the second being as a production line coder. For me, Leo’s greatest and only real drawback is the learning curve. This learning curve can be shallow is if all that is required is that someone code using Leo. However, in our company we allocate 40 to 80 hours *on top* of the normal coding load for someone to come up to speed on Leo. The ROI (return on investment) is calculated by me to be on the order of 3 months. So if I hire a consultant for less than 3 months, I don’t teach him Leo, even though all source code in our company must reside in Leo files for the reasons I won’t go into now.

I consider that my coders are 15 to 30 percent more efficient in their daily operations than my competition’s people. This indefensible claim of mine is based on the changes in my productivity as Leo grew from a test document production tool to the primary production method for all our assembly, c and cpp source code.

Personally, I hate to deal with documentation when I write code, except:

1) When I am first sitting down to solve a new problem.
   Then the documentation becomes quite long-winded and pontificatory,
   as if I were the only one on earth smart enough to solve the problem - or
2) When I come back to code I or someone else has written and find the documentation insufficient to
   understand the code without study (seems to be most of the time).

So I do not require my engineers or myself to do a great job of documentation, nor do I use Leo for that purpose. Rather, it is Leo’s outlining and organizing ability, and Leo’s ability to create source files from within the outline that give me what I think is a tremendous competitive advantage. Each of my company’s products run on all versions of windows from Win 3.1 to XP. In our flagship software piece, there are ten main modules, and each module is maintained by one single Leo file. In the CODEC module, one Leo file named compress.leo organizes and creates seven .asm files, forty-four .c files, twenty .h files, two .def files, four .mak files, etc. etc. etc. This one file can be checked out from source code control and given to an engineer for the addition of a new feature.

In it are contained all the known issues for the CODEC, each issue arranged in its own clone section. One clone section groups together every routine, variable or type definition that must change between different versions of Windows. These sections could be from six different c source files, two assembly files, and eight .h files. Another clone section groups together those sections relating to memory problems, which change according to the memory configuration and TSR configuration (or lack thereof) on the target machine. Another clone section groups sections that fail (or don’t fail) if the routine in question was accidentally run during the dreaded ‘interrupt time’. Another clone section is a section containing clones, each of which is named after the major bug that was fixed when the engineer who fixed the bug grouped a bunch of routines, definitions, etc. together to fix the bug.

None of the above clone sections was ‘designed’ into the document. Just the opposite happens. When the codec was first written, there was just a single Leo file with a bunch of sections for each c routine or assembly module. As the product grew and was tested on various platforms, each failure of the module was organized into clones each time a failure was fixed. This is what I call “SELF DOCUMENTING CODE”. This has nothing to do with me sitting and documenting anything. Its just that the STRUCTURE of a bug fix (or product enhancement) lives on long after the coding is done, as long as no one is foolish enough to delete the cloned sections that ‘DOCUMENT’ what happened.

In actual practice, this organizational ‘history’ is so powerful that I can’t begin to describe it. A ‘REVERSE LEARNING CURVE’ happens when an engineer gets a Leo file that already has the ‘interrupt time sensitive’ routines grouped together by the last unfortunate soul who had to work on them. There may not be any more written documentation, but the knowledge contained in the structure can be breathtaking. It is certainly time saving. I find this particularly true in my own case. Often I’ll look at some code that seems totally unfamiliar and think ‘what idiot wrote this crap’. Then I’ll look at the version control comments and realize that I wrote the crap. Then for sure I know the documentation is non-existent, but the clones I used to develop it are still there, and they always serve to refresh my memory in an indescribable way.

Enough of this commentary, I just looked at the clock. Best wishes to anyone willing to try Leo for a week. I hope you will be glad you did.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.13">The Word outlines are very useful. But Leo makes Word look like a clunky toy.

#1 Reason would probably be clone nodes. One node can point to another. Another
way of putting this is is that a leaf can be on more than one tree. For
example, suppose you have a list of recipes. You simultaneously put a single
recipe under multiple categories or even multiple hierarchies. You could put "3
bean enchilada" simultaneously under Recipes-Mexican and Food-Gas. Another
example would be, if you are a biologist trying to decide under which genus to
put a new species, you could put the species under two simultaneously. In
effect, you can build a 3-D tree. For a further illustration see
http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm

#2 Reason would probably be that Leo outlines can be embedded in external text
files. So, a Leo outline is more than an outline, it is a meta-structure that
can be added to another text without changing that text, but rather providing
an external road map to the text. Microsoft Word has a text (xml) version with a
commenting convention, so Leo can even be used to add outlines into Word docs,
altho it isn't set up to do that now. For example, see
http://www.3dtree.com/ev/e/sbooks/leo/sbframetoc_ie.htm In this case, the upper
window of Leo is the meta-structure, and the bottom window is the file to which
the meta-structure is being applied, viewed one node at a time.

I may not have made #2 very clear, but it is actually a very useful feature. It
takes some getting used to before one sees all of the possibilities tho. One
way to think of it is that Leo allows you to throw external documents into your
outline, and yet the external document remains independent and can still be
edited separately.

Some other cool things about Leo which Word doesn't feature:
1. Pure xml output that is easy to transform into other formats (next
version of Word will have true XML format, but not as easy to work with).
One consequence of this is that Leo files can be transformed pretty easily
to web pages with their outlining capability intact.
2. Easy to add features since is programmed in Tk and open source. Maybe
your average user can't start hacking on it, but a surprising amount can be
tacked on by flipping through the Tk manual.
3. Free, opensource, multi-platform
4. Leo is scriptable with Python. It should be possible to build a Tickler
into Leo using Python scripting, for example.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.14">First of all, kudos to you for the excellent progress you've been making with Leo.  I upgraded today after about three months of using and older version and I was thrilled to see all the great improvements that have happened so fast.  I especially love the ability to go to next clone.  I think you're really showing what open source can do and your current trajectory puts you on track to kick Emacs into the dustbin of computing history.

So today I copied all my data (personal information manager and project management stuff) out of my old outliner (ThoughtManager, which syncs with and runs on the Palm) and put it into Leo.  It took me hours to do it and then to rearrange it the way I really wanted it.  But having the ability to make clones and have different ways to view my data is, as you know, fabulous.  In my case, for personal information and project management things, I used the flexibility of clones to allow me to see my data in several different views: 1) by project, the logical hierarchical breakdown by topic, 2) by person, so whenever I'm talking to someone I can easily see all the pending items related to them which may be spread over multiple projects, 3) by priority, so I can see what needs to get done sooner and what can wait for later and, 4) a special case of priority called "Today" for the things I'm going to focus on in the coming hours.

Now here's why I don't miss the ability of my old outliner to synch the entire outline with the Palm.  It turns out the main thing I really want in the Palm is the top category "Today" so all I have to do is have Leo flatten that one heading into a text file (and it kindly remembers the name and directory of the file I used last time) and then I'm done because I've told the Palm Hotsync manager that that file should be sent to Palm memo pad every time I synch.  The Palm Hotsync manager does a nice job of sending a text file to the Palm memo pad and even breaks the file up into multiple memo records if it's too big to fit in just one.  So that gives me enough to be able to browse (or full text search) the small amount of data that I really want right inside my Palm (which is also my cell phone).  Quick and dirty but it works.

For times when I want my whole outline with me, Leo wins again because thanks to its cross platform nature I can take my whole outline with me on my Mac iBook, even though I usually edit it on a Windows PC (which is the only kind of machine my old outliner would run on).  Quite frankly, although my old outliner was able to shoehorn the whole thing into my palm/cellphone, it was a pain to access it on the small screen and slow processor.  Now when I anticipate I'll need the whole thing, for example when I'm going to a meeting, I can put it on my Mac iBook (under X and Fink for now until Python can do it native under Aqua) and have real, full access to it all.

I think now in addition to being great for programming Leo is also a great PIM.  Being able to flatten a strategically chosen portion of the outline into a known file name that the Palm synch manager has been told to send to the Palm on every synch does the trick for me.  I wonder if you would consider something like an @flatten directive so I can have that done automatically for me every time I save my outline?  For now it's up to me to flatten the node I want manually, although once I've done that the transfer to the Palm is automatic.

You're my hero!  Thank you so much.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.15">Another day, another breakthrough using Leo -- now I realize Leo is the 
best URL bookmark manager there is.  No more bookmarks menus or 
favorites lists inside the browser for me.  With the @url directive I 
can just double click on the URL to open it in my browser.  Leo lets me 
arrange the URLs in a hierarchy (or multiple hierarchies), attach notes 
to them, save clippings of things I read on the sites.  It's sooo much 
better than anything the browsers have built in and it lets me easily 
use different browsers on different platforms and different machines 
(try that with the browsers' built-in bookmark managers).  

When using Leo as a project manager and personal information manager as 
I do I can heavily annotate every task and project with helpful and 
relevant URLs.  And since URLs can be of the ``file://`` form, they're not 
just for web pages or HTML documents;  I can link to any file on my disk 
of any type to be opened by any program.

Leo is a quantum leap for me in terms of how many projects I can manage 
and how much information I can find and organize and store in a useful 
way.  I'm a data-mining army of one now and the web is my playground. 
Every time I find a web page that has interesting links to others, 
those links get stored in my Leo outline too, right where I can find 
them and make practical use of them.  I can easily accept dozens of 
valuable links every day and integrate them into what I'm doing in a way 
that I'm confidant they won't get lost or forgotten.  Before I always 
used to get bogged down by the difficulty of managing bookmarks inside 
the browser.  But now I'm no longer the victim of information overload 
buried in the knowledge landslide of the Internet;  instead I'm the 
professional strip miner with the world's biggest bulldozer.  I eagerly 
plunge into mountains of data and emerge with all the valuable 
information nuggets neatly stored and organized.  And my storehouse of 
knowledge is a flexible thing where I can reorganize and prioritize and 
massage the data to my heart's content as I learn more about it and 
decide to use it in different ways for different purposes.  It's the 
difference between the pick axe and the steam shovel for me.

<t tx="ekr.20050830074815.16">This year my accountant is getting a beautiful printout generated by 
LaTeX and Leo.  I have a complicated tax situation this year, but I got 
it all laid out and organized in Leo.  Then I had each of the nodes that 
had something my accountant needs to see write the data out to a file in 
the form a LaTeX table.

Sometimes a row of a table would have a result that was calculated by 
adding up a list of numbers.  For that I used the modern day equivalent 
of an adding machine paper tape -- I stored a lisp s-expression in a Leo 
comment.  I like s-expressions for this because once I put the opening 
"(+" on one line and the closing ")" on another line, I can fill in 
additional numbers just by typing them and can even annotate them with 
comments.  So in the middle of generating a LaTeX file I might have 
something like this::

    @
    (+
    1165.26 1823.70 ; May 2002
    123.38 ; June 2002
    13.50 ; July 2002
    13.21 ; October 2002
    55.25 ; November 2002
    )
    @c

That's an annotated record of how I arrived at the number the accountant 
will actually see.  I can just paste it into any lisp or scheme 
interpreter and get the total.  Adding additional numbers is easy.

For next year, I think I might  take this a step further.  What I did 
this year is good for adding up numbers to get a total for one row of a 
LaTeX table.  But it turns out I'd also like some more processing done 
on those tables (which I had to do by hand this time) -- I'd like the 
rows sorted in reverse order by magnitude (so that the big numbers jump 
out at you from the start of the tables) and I'd like a total of all the 
rows in the table. So I think next year, instead of having an 
s-expression that computes the total of one row for me, I think I'll use 
s-expressions that generate whole tables, formatted for LaTex, from the 
underlying data.  So I'm thinking next year my s-expressions might look 
more like this::

    @

The job of that "table" function would be to return the LaTeX code 
needed to display a table with the category names and values, sorted 
descending by magnitude, with the total displayed.  It's sort of a poor 
man's way of doing a spreadsheet inside Leo and then making it look 
great using LaTeX.  The idea would be as I wanted to add more data, I'd 
add it to the s-expression and then reevaluate the whole thing by 
pasting it into a lisp interpreter and then copying the result back into 
the same Leo node for LaTeX to process.

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.2">First, read the tutorial_. This will be enough to get you started if you just
want to use Leo as an outliner_. If you intend to use Leo for programming, read
the `Quick start for programmers`_, then look at Leo's source code in the file ``LeoPy.leo``.
Spend 5 or 10 minutes browsing through the outline. Don't worry about details;
just look for the following common usage patterns:

-   The (Projects) tree shows how to use clones to represent tasks.

-   Study ``@file leoNodes.py``.
    It shows how to define more than one class in single file.

-   Most other files show how to use a single ``@others`` directive to define one class.

-   Most methods are defined using ``@others``, *not* section definition nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.4">.. _`Clones &amp; views`:   intro.html#clones-views

You will lose much of Leo's power if you don't use clones.
See `Clones &amp; views`_ for full details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.5">Use `@file`_ trees (including ``@thin`` trees) unless you are *sure* you must
have the extra flexibility of `@root`_ trees.
Indeed, `@file`_ trees are much easier to use than `@root`_ trees:

- `@file`_ trees use less markup than `@root`_ trees.
  In particular, the `@others directive`_ is valid only within `@file`_ trees.

- You must explicitly tangle_ and untangle_ `@root`_ trees using the `Tangle and Untangle`_ commands.

However, `@root`_ trees are more flexible than `@file`_ trees:

- Sections_ may be defined anywhere within `@root`_ trees.
  Moreover, the `@unit`_ directive_ expands the scope of section definitions in `@root`_ trees
  so that a section may be referenced in several `@root`_ trees.

- The meaning of section definitions in `@root`_ trees are independent of their position within the tree.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.7">Use methods for any code that is used (called or referenced) more than once.

Sections_ are convenient in the following circumstances:

-   When you want to refer to snippets of code the can not be turned into methods.
    For example, many plugins start with the code like this::

    &lt;&lt; docstring &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; version history &gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt; globals &gt;&gt;

    None of these sections could be replaced by methods.

-   When you want to refer to a snippet of code that shares local variables with the enclosing code.
    This is surprisingly easy and safe to do, *provided* the section is used only in one place.
    `Section names`_ in such contexts can be clearer than method names.  For example::

    &lt;&lt; init ivars for writing &gt;&gt;

In short, I create sections when convenient,
and convert them to functions or methods if they need to be used in several places.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.9">Internally, Leo represents all strings as unicode. Leo translates from a
particular encoding to Unicode_ when reading .leo files or `derived files`_. Leo
translates from Unicode_ to a particular encoding when writing `derived files`_. You
may see strange looking characters if your text editor is expecting a different
encoding. The encoding used in any `derived file`_ is shown in the ``#@+leo`` `sentinel line`_
like this::

    #@+leo-encoding=iso-8859-1.

**Exception**: the encoding is ``UTF-8`` if no ``-encoding=`` field exists.
You can also use the ``@encoding`` directive_ to set the encoding for individual `derived files`_.
If no ``@encoding`` directive_ is in effect,
Leo uses the following settings_ to translate to and from unicode:

default_derived_file_encoding
    The encoding used for derived files if no ``@encoding`` directive_ is in effect.
    This setting also controls the encoding of files created by the ``Tangle`` commands.
    The default is ``UTF-8`` (case not important).

new_leo_file_encoding
    The encoding specified in the following line of new .leo files::

        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"&gt;

    The default is ``UTF-8`` (upper case for compatibility for old versions of Leo).
    **Important**: once a .leo file is created the ``&lt;?xml..."&gt;`` line can only be changed by hand.
    This may cause unicode errors the next time the .leo file is loaded,
    so you should change the ``&lt;?xml..."&gt;`` line by hand only when first creating a .leo file.
    
tk_encoding
    The encoding that Leo uses to communicate with Tk text widgets.
    You would typically use this setting only in an emergency.
    The section called::

        &lt;&lt; set app.tkEncoding &gt;&gt;

    in app.finishCreate sets this encoding as follows:
    
    a) using the ``tk_encoding`` setting if it exists,
    b) using ``locale.getpreferredencoding`` if it exists,
       or the equivalent code in pre-python 2.3 versions,
    c) using ``sys.getdefaultencoding``
    d) defaulting to ``"utf-8"``
    
    Neither b nor c are guaranteed to give a valid encoding in all systems,
    and Leo will ignore invalid encodings returned from b or c.
    Therefore, setting the ``tk_encoding`` setting may be needed.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.10">The encoding used in the file being imported doesn't match the encoding in effect for Leo.
You have two options:

- Use the ``@encoding`` directive_ in an ancestor of the node_ selected when
  doing the ``Import`` command_ to specify the encoding of file to be imported.

- Set the ``tk_encoding`` setting_ (see the previous answer) to the encoding you normally use.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.12">Using `@thin`_ trees can eliminate most problems with using Leo in cvs environments:

-   Developers should use `@thin`_ trees to create derived files in any kind of cooperative environment.

-   The cvs repository contains "reference" .leo files.
    These reference files should containing nothing but ``@thin`` nodes.
    Reference files will change only when new derived files get added to the project.

    **Important**:
    Leo's `cvs repository`_ contains the *reference* versions of the following .leo files:
    ``LeoPyRef.leo`` and ``LeoPluginsRef.leo``.
    However,  Leo's distributions contain the *non-reference* versions of those files:
    ``LeoPy.leo`` and ``LeoPlugins.leo``.
    These two files have many ``@thin`` nodes.
    There is no reference file for ``test.leo`` even though it contains ``@thin leoTest.py``.
    It would be clumsy to use testRef.leo, and there is less need to do so.
    
-   Developers will use local copies of reference files for their own work.
    For example, instead of using ``LeoPyRef.leo`` directly,
    I use a copy called ``LeoPy.leo``.
    My local copy can contain nodes other than ``@thin`` nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.13"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.14">You have two options, depending on whether you want to be able to use sections
or not.

-   Use `@nosent`_ trees.
    Files derived from ``@nosent`` trees contain no sentinels_.
    However, Leo create the `derived file`_ just as in `@file`_ trees.
    In particular, Leo expands section references and understands the ``@others`` directive.

-   Use `@asis`_ trees.
    Files derived from ``@asis`` trees contain no sentinels_.
    Moreover, Leo does not expand section references in ``asis`` trees.
    In other words, Leo creates the `derived file` simply by writing all body text in outline order.
    Leo can't update the outline unless the derived file contains sentinels,
    so Leo does not update ``@nosent`` trees or ``@asis`` trees automatically when
    you change the derived file in an external editor.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.16">You have two options, depending on whether you want sentinel lines in your
derived file or not.

-   Use `@noref`_ trees.
    Leo creates files derived from ``@noref`` trees by writing all the nodes of the
    tree to the derived file in outline order.
    The derived file *does* contain some sentinels,
    so you *can* update ``@noref`` trees from changes made to derived files.

-   Use `@asis`_ trees.
    Files derived from ``@asis`` trees contain no sentinels.
    Leo creates the derived file simply by writing all body text in outline order.
    Leo can't update the outline unless the derived file contains sentinels,
    so Leo does not update ``@asis`` trees automatically when you change the derived file in an external editor.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.17">The import commands insert ``@ignore`` directives_ in the top-level node_.
Leo does this so that you won't accidentally overwrite your files after importing them.
Change the filename following ``@file`` or ``@root`` as desired,
then remove the ``@ignore`` directive_.
Saving the outline will then create the `derived file`_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.18">**Question**: I'm writing a Windows Script Component, which is an XML file with
a CData section containing javascript. I can get the XML as I want it by using
``@language html``, but how can I get the tangling comments inside the CData
section to be java-style comments rather than html ones?

**Answer**: In `@file`_ trees you use the ``@delims`` directive_ to change comment delimiters.
For example::

    @delims /* */ 
    Javascript stuff 
    @delims &lt;-- --&gt; 
    HTML stuff

**Important**: Leo can not revert to previous delimiters automatically;
you must change back to previous delimiters using another ``@delims`` directive_.

In `@root`_ trees you can work around this problem using the ``@silent`` directive_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.19">By Zvi Boshernitzan:
I was having trouble disabling ``&lt;?php`` with comments (and couldn't override the
comment character for the start of the page).
Finally, I found a solution that worked, using php's heredoc string syntax::

    @first &lt;?php
    @first $comment = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOD
    EOD;
    
    // php code goes here.
    echo "boogie";
    
    $comment2 = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOD
    @last EOD;
    @last ?&gt;

or::

    @first &lt;?php
    @first /*
    */
    
    echo "hi";
    
    @delims /* */
    @last ?&gt;</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.20">Here is a posting which might be helpful:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2300457 The ``@first``
directive_ is the key to output usable code in unsupported languages. For
example, to use Leo with the Basic language, use the following::

    @first $IFDEF LEOHEADER
    @delims '
    @c
    $ENDIF

So this would enable a basic compiler to "jump" over the "true" LEO-header-lines.
Like this::

    $IFDEF LEOHEADER &lt;-conditional compilation directive 
    #@+leo-ver=4 &lt;-these lines not compiled
    #@+node:@file QParser005.INC
    #@@first
    #@delims ' 
    '@@c
    $ENDIF &lt;-... Until here!
    &lt;rest of derived code file ... &gt;

This changes the comment symbol the apostrophe,
making comments parseable by a BASIC (or other language.)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.21">Use the @first directive_ in `@file`_ trees or `@nosent`_ trees.
Use the @silent directive in `@root`_ trees.

The ``@first`` directive puts lines at the very start of files derived from ``@file``.
For example, the body text of ``@file spam.py`` might be::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python

The body text of ``@file foo.perl`` might be::

    @first #/usr/bin/perl

Leo recognizes the ``@first`` directive_ only at the start of the body text of `@file`_ nodes.
No text may precede ``@first`` directives_.
More than one ``@first`` directive may exist, like this::

    @first #! /usr/bin/env python
    @first # more comments.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.22">Leo has good support for `CWEB`_.
`@file`_ trees can organize any part of CWEB code using *noweb* sections.
You can also use `@asis`_, `@noref`_ or `@nosent`_ trees to create cweb files.
See `CWEB mode`_ for full details.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.24">No.  Everything in an `@file`_ trees must be part of the derived file: orphan and
``@ignore`` nodes are invalid in ``@file`` trees. This restriction should not be
troublesome. For example, you can organize your outline like this::

    + myClass
    ..+ ignored stuff
    ..+ @file myClass

(As usual, + denotes a headline.)
So you simply create a new node_, called myClass, that holds your `@file`_ trees and stuff you don't want in the `@file`_ trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.25">By Rich Ries.
Some older C compilers don't understand the "//" comment symbol, so using ``@language C`` won't work.
Moreover, the following does not always work either::

    @comment /* */

This generates the following sentinel line::

    /*@@comment /* */*/"

in the output file, and not all C compilers allow nested comments, so the last ``*\/`` generates an error.
The solution is to use::

    #if 0
    @comment /* */
    #endif

Leo is happy: it recognizes the ``@comment`` directive_.
The C compiler is happy: the C preprocessor strips out the offending line before the C
compiler gets it.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.26"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.29">See the instructions are in ``LeoPy.leo`` in::

    ``Notes:How To:How to add support for a new language section.

This section contains clones of all relevant parts of Leo that you will change.
Coming in Leo 4.4: Leo will use ``JEdit``'s language description files to drive the syntax colorer.
To add support for a new language, just add another such description file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.30">You have two options: 
 
-   Get cvs write access, and add the `@thin`_ file to the plugins directory.

-   Just send the `@thin`_ file to me at edreamleo@charter.net.
    That's all you need to do.  In particular that there is no need to change ``leoPlugins.leo``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.74">The Import Files dialog allows you to select multiple files provided you are running Python 2.3 or above.
There is also an importFiles script in ``LeoPy.leo``.  You can use that script as follows::

    import leoImport
    leoImport.importFiles(aDirectory, ".py")

This will import all .py files from aDirectory, which should be a full path to a particular directory.
You could use ".c" to import all .c files, etc.</t>

When building Tcl on Linux, do not specify "--enable-threads"
Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.

Here is how to build Tk without thread support:

- Go to www.tcl.tk, and download the sources for Tcl and Tk.
- Build those two pack's as is told in the "How to Compile Tcl Source Releases"
- Go to www.python.org and download your favorite Python (2.3.5 for me).
- Build it as is told on the download page.
- Enjoy using Leo on Linux.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.76"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.77">Just run Leo in a console window. At the point you want to drop into the
debugger, execute this line::

    g.pdb()

All output from pdb goes to stdout, which is the console window. It would be
good to create a subclass of pdb.Pdb that uses Leo's log pane rather than a
console window, but I haven't done that. It could be done easily enough in a
plugin...

**Important**: I recommend using g.trace instead of pdb.  For example::

    g.trace(x)

prints the name of the function or method containing the trace, and the value of
x. g.callers is often useful in combination with g.trace. g.callers(5)
returns the last 5 entries of the call stack. For example::

    g.trace(x,g.callers(5))

Used this way, g.trace shows you patterns that will be invisible using pdb.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.113">**Question**:
It would be nice if Leo could open empty files. I tend to be "document oriented"
rather than "application oriented" in my thinking and prefer "create empty file
at location -&gt; open it with program" to "start program -&gt; create new file -&gt;
save it at location".

**Answer** by Paul Paterson:
If you are on Windows 98/2000/XP then the procedure is as follows...

1. Start Leo
2. Click New
3. Click Save as...
4. Save the file as "c:\windows\shellnew\leofile.leo" (or c:\winnt for 2000/XP)
5. Open regedit "start...run...regedit"
6. Open HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and find the ".leo" extension type
7. Go New ... Key from the context menu 
8. Call the new key ShellNew 
9. Select the new key, right-click, choose New...String Value from the context menu
10. Call it FileName 
11. Double-click on the string, and modify it to be the filename of the leofile.leo file you created,
    including the extension
12. Exit the registry editor and restart Windows Explorer (you may need to reboot on Windows 98)

Now you should have a New:Leo File option in Explorer. This creates a duplicate
of the file you saved. This can be useful because you could make a template Leo
file containing some standard nodes_ that you always have and then save this.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.114">By Dave Hein: The cause of the keymapping problem is a issue with the X11
keyboard mapping, not with Tk. If you have this problem on your system, issue
the command::

    xmodmap -pke 

and look in the results for the line for keycode 22. I'll bet it shows something like::

    keycode 22 = BackSpace Terminate_Server

That second token ("Terminate_Server") is what is supposed to be mapped to
Shift-Backspace. You want this second token to be either not present or to be
BackSpace. To fix this, create a file (e.g. .Xmodmap) and give it the content::

    keycode 22 = BackSpace

then run the command::

    xmodmap .Xmodmap

This fixes the problem. On my system this also disables the ability to terminate
the X server using Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace. This is because of some conflict with xdb
(xdb is the newer keyboard mapping facility in XFree86; xmodmap is the old
original X11 keyboard mapping facility). I'm still working on that. I'm also not
able to get xmodmap to make this change during X11 startup (again because of
conflicts with xdb). But I'm working on that as well.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.115">For the most part, docutils_ does a good job of reporting errors. docutils_ prints
a message to the console and inserts an unmistakable error message in the
generated .html file. **Important**: On Windows it is helpful to `Run Leo from a
console window`_.

However, in some cases, docutils_ crashes instead of properly reporting the
problem. There are several workarounds:

1.  The crashes I have seen arise from the following bug in docutils.
    **Hyperlinks in image:: markup must be lower case**.  This will work::

        .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: faq_

    This will **crash**::

        .. |back| image:: arrow_lt.gif
            :target: FAQ_

    So avoid this crash by making sure to use lower case targets in ``:target:`` markup.

2.  You can change the docutils_ source slightly so that it prints a traceback when it
    crashes. (The rst3 plugin should be able to do this, but I haven't figured
    out how yet.) It's easy enough to do this:

    - Find the file ``core.py`` in top-level ``docutils`` folder.
      Typically this folder will be in Python's ``site-packages`` folder.

    - Open ``core.py`` in some editor other than Leo.

    - Find the method called ``report_Exceptions``.

    - Insert the following lines at the very start of this method::

        print 'EKR: added traceback'
        import traceback ; traceback.print_exc()

    This will cause a traceback whenever docutils_ crashes. I have found that
    such tracebacks are generally enough to locate the general area of the
    problem. **Note**: These tracebacks go to the console window, so you should
    `Run Leo from a console window`_.

3.  As a last resort, you can isolate syntax errors by reducing your input files
    until they work again, then adding sections until you get a crash. This is
    easy enough to do (when using the `rst3 plugin`_) by change a headline ``x`` to
    ``@rst-ignore-tree x``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.116">From: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3240374
Using Leo's ``File-Export-Flatten Outline`` commands creates a ``MORE`` style outline which places
all Leo body sections on the left margin.
The headlines_ are indented with tabs which Excel will read as a tab delimited format.
Once inside Excel there are benefits.

1.  The most obvious benefit inside Excel is that the body sections (Excel first
    column) can be selected easily and highlighted with a different font color.
    This makes the ``MORE`` format very readable. Save a copy of your sheet as HTML
    and now you have a web page with the body sections highlighted.

2.  It is possible to hide columns in Excel.
    Hiding the first column leaves just the headlines showing.

3.  Formulas based on searching for a string can do calculations in Excel.
    For example if a heading ``"Current Assets"`` appears on level 4 then the body formula::

        =INDEX(A:A,MATCH("Current Assets",D:D,0)+1)

    will retrieve it.
    The +1 after match looks down one row below the matched headline.
    The trick is to place all your headlines in quotes because Excel will see ``+ "Current Assets"``
    from the ``MORE`` outline.
    When Excel tries without the quotes it thinks it is a range name and
    displays a ``#N/A`` error instead of the headline.
    Also you must place a child node_ below to get the + sign instead of a - sign which would give a
    ``MORE`` headline of  ``-"Current assets"`` , also is an error.

I think there is some interesting possibility here because of the enforcement of
Leo `body text`_ being always in the first column. The Leo outline provides
additional reference to organizing the problem not typical of spreadsheet
models. Beyond scripting in Python, Excel is good at doing interrelated
calculations and detecting problems like circular references. In Excel
Tools-Options-General is a setting for r1c1 format which then shows numbers
instead of letters for column references. Using this would allow entries like
this in the leo body::

    1000
    3500
    =R[-1]C+R[-2]C

<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.119">By Rich Ries.
I often rework C code that's already been "Leo-ized"--the first pass was quick
and dirty to get it going. When I do subsequent passes, I wind up with subnodes
that are out of order with the sequence found in the main node_. It's not a big
deal, but I like 'em ordered. With just one editor pane, clicking on the node_ to
move would switch focus to that node_. I'd then need to re-focus on the main
node_. A minor nuisance, but it does slow you down.

My solution is to open a second editor with its focus on the main node_. Switch
to the other editor, and, referring to the first editor pane, move the nodes as
you like. The second editor's pane will change focus to the node_ you're moving,
but the first editor will stay focused on the main node_. It's a lot easier to
do than to describe!
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830115714.120">One way is to link directly to the media file from a Leo node_ (with ``@url``)
and write a scriptbutton to wrap all URL-nodes under the current node_ in a
single HTML page (using the HTML browser trick at
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1201579&amp;forum_id=10226).

Then, you can view your media in two ways:

-   Individually. You can directly click on the ``@url`` link to display the media
    in the browser (assuming you have your MIME/filetype associations set up
    correctly for your browser).

-   In a group. You can click on a script button (you have to code this yourself,
    very simple) which should collect all ``@url`` nodes_ under the current node_
    and dynamically generate a HTML page displaying either links to or embedded
    versions of the media (using the HTML trick described above to invoke the
    browser). This way, you can create collections of ``@url`` nodes under a
    single node_ (like a bookmark folder), and press a single button to view the
    ``@url`` collection as a single entity in the browser (with all browser
    capabilities like displaying the media).
    
You could probably generalize this idea of "collect all ``@url`` nodes under current
node_ and display as HTML in browser" into a general-purpose plugin. However,
the plugin would have to be somewhat smart in mapping a link to its corresponding
HTML code (e.g. an image link gets mapped to an &lt;img&gt; HTML tag, a link to a
Flash file gets mapped to an &lt;embed&gt; tag, etc).</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050830120844">``c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable`` will append items to the end of an existing menu.
For example, the following script will add a new item at the end of the 'File' menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):
        g.trace()
    
    table = (("Test1",None,callback),)
    
    c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable('File',table)

Plugins can do anything that can be done with ``Tk`` using the menu returned by ``c.frame.menu.getMenu``.
For example, here is a script that adds a Test menu item after the 'Open With' menu item in the File menu::

    def callback(*args,**keys):
        g.trace()
    
    fileMenu = c.frame.menu.getMenu('File')

    # 3 is the position in the menu.  Other kinds of indices are possible.
    fileMenu.insert(3,'command',label='Test2',command=callback)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050830120857">The trick is to create a workflow that separates editing from testing. Putting
test code in ``LeoPy.leo`` would waste a lot of time. To run tests you would
have to exit Leo and reload ``LeoPy.leo``. A much quicker way is to put all test
code in a ``test.leo`` file. So to change and test code, do the following:

1. Save ``LeoPy.leo`` but do **not** exit Leo. 

2. Quit the copy of Leo running test.leo, then reload test.leo.

3. Run test scripts from test.leo.

That's all. Python will recompile any changed .py files in the new copy of Leo.
**Note**: I create a batch file called t.bat that runs test.leo, so to the
"edit-reload-test" cycle is just:

1. Control-S (in ``LeoPy.leo``: saves the .leo file)
2. t         (in a console window: runs test.leo, compiling all changed .py files as a side effect)
3. Control-E (in test.leo: runs the test script)

The benefits of the new workflow:

- test.leo loads  _much_ more quickly than ``LeoPy.leo`` does.
  This new approach can increase the speed of the edit-reload-test cycle by more than a factor of 10.
  Hitting Control-S, t, Control-E takes about 5 seconds.

- ``LeoPy.leo`` runs with the *old* code,
  so it is much easier to fix syntax errors or exceptions in the *new* code:
  just fix the problem and save ``LeoPy.leo`` *without* closing ``LeoPy.leo``,
  then restart test.leo.
  You run your tests on the new code, but you edit the new code with the old, stable code.

- test.leo is the perfect place to develop test.
  I can create and organize those tests and when I am done, ''test.leo'' is a log of my work.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050901073048">**Important**: We often refer to outline_ nodes_ by the directives_ they contain.
For example, an `@root node`_ is a node containing an @root directive_, etc.
**Exception**: An `@file node`_ is a node whose *headline* starts with ``@file``.

.. _`@auto node`:
.. _`@file node`:
.. _`@thin node`:
.. _`@root node`:
.. _`@file nodes`:
.. _`@thin nodes`:
.. _`@root nodes`:

``@file node``
    An ``@file`` node_ is a node whose *headline* starts with ``@file``.
    **Important**: Headlines_ that start with ``@file-asis``, ``@file-noref``, ``@file-nosent``
    (and their abbreviations ``@asis``, ``@noref``, ``@nosent``) are collectively called ``@file`` nodes.

.. _`@auto tree`:
.. _`@file tree`:
.. _`@thin tree`:
.. _`@root tree`:
.. _`@file trees`:
.. _`@thin trees`:
.. _`@root trees`:

``@file tree, @others tree, @root tree, etc.``
    An @file tree_ is a tree whose root_ is an @file node, etc.

``@asis, @auto, @file, @noref, @nosent, @thin``
    Headlines_ that start with one of these create (correspond to) `derived files`_.
    The following synonyms exist::

        @asis, @file-asis
        @noref, @file-noref
        @nosent, @file-nosent

    For more information, see the documentation for `@asis`_, `@auto`_, `@file`_, `@noref`_, `@nosent`_ and `@thin`_
    in Leo's `programming reference`_ chapter.
    
    **New in Leo 4.4.4**: @auto trees allow you to edit derived files that contain no sentinels.
    Leo will import the @auto files when reading .leo files.  Be careful when first creating the @auto node.
    *Before* saving the .leo file containing the new @auto node,
    use the read-at-auto-nodes command to do the initial import.

.. _`@all`:
.. _`@all directive`:

``@all``
    A directive_ that copies the `body text`_ of all nodes_ in an `@thin` tree to the corresponding `derived file`_.

``Clone Arrow``
    A small red arrow in the `icon box`_ indicating that the node_ is a clone_.

.. _`code part`:

.. _`derived file`:
.. _`derived files`:

``Derived file``
    The file created as the result of tangling_ a node containing an ``@root`` directive_.
    The file consists of the expansion of the text following the ``@root`` directive_.
    For more information, see the `derived files section`_ of `Leo's tutorial`_.

.. _`descendant`:
.. _`descendants`:

``Descendant``
    An offspring_ of a node_.  That is, a child_, grandchild_, etc. of a node.

.. _`doc part`:
.. _`doc parts`:

``Doc part, @doc part, document part, etc.``
    A part_ of a `section definition`_ that contains comments.
    Doc parts start with ``@`` and continue until the ``@c`` directive_ or the end of the `body text`_.
    In `@root trees`_, doc parts are associated with the immediately following `code part`_, if any.

.. _`escape convention`:
.. _`escape conventions`:

``Escape convention``
    A convention for representing sequences of characters that would otherwise have special meaning.
    Leo has only one such convention:
    in `@root trees`_, ``@@`` in the leftmost column of a `code part`_ stands for a single ``@`` character.
    **Important**:
    Leo does not support `noweb's`_ ``@&lt;&lt;`` and ``@&gt;&gt;`` escape conventions.
    Any line containing matched ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` is a `section reference`_, regardless of context.
    To use ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` as ordinary characters, place them on separate lines.

.. _expand:
.. _expands:
.. _expanded:

``expand``
    To make the children_ of a node_ visible.

.. _`grandchild`:
.. _`grandchildren`:

``Grandchild``
    The child_ of a child of a node_.

.. _`headline`:
.. _`headlines`:
.. _`headline text`:

``Headline``
    The headline text of a node_.  The part of the node visible in the `outline pane`_

.. _`hoist`:
.. _`hoisted`:
.. _`dehoist`:

``Hoist &amp; dehoist``
    Hoisting a node_ redraws the screen that node and its descendants_ becomes the only visible part of the outline_.
    Leo prevents the you from moving nodes outside the hoisted outline.  Dehoisting a node restores the outline.
    Multiple hoists may be in effect: each dehoist undoes the effect of the immediately preceding hoist.

.. _`icon box`:
.. _`icon boxes`:

.. _`LaTex`:

``LaTex``
    A markup language often used in `literate programming` environments.
    See: http://www.latex-project.org/

    In particular, organizing nodes do not affect indentation in `derived files`_.

.. _`orphan`:
.. _`orphan node`:
.. _`orphan nodes`:

``Orphan node``
    A node_ that would not be copied to a `derived file`_.
    Orphan nodes can arise because an `@thin tree`_ has no ``@others`` or ``@all`` directives_.
    Sections_ that are defined but not used also create orphan nodes.

    Leo issues a warning when attempting to write an `@thin tree`_ containing orphan nodes,
    and does not save the `derived file`_.
    No information is lost; Leo saves the information in the `@thin tree`_ in the .leo file.
    Leo will load the `@thin tree`_ from the .leo file the next time Leo opens the .leo file.

.. _`outline`:
.. _`outliner`:
.. _`outlines`:

``Outline``
    - A node_ and its descendants_.
    - A tree_
    - All the nodes_ of a .leo file.

.. _`outline order`:

``Outline Order``
    The order that nodes_ appear on the screen when all nodes_ are expanded.

``pdf file``
    A file that can be read by Adobe Acrobat.

.. _`plugin`:
.. _`plugins`:

``Plugin``
    - A Python file in Leo's ``plugins`` folder.
    - A way to modify and extend Leo without changing Leo's core code.
      ``leoPlugins.leo`` contains all of Leo's official plugins.

    See `Writing plugins and hooks`.

.. _`promote`:

``Promote``
    To move all children_ of a node_ in an outline so that they become siblings_ of the node.

.. _reStructuredText:
.. _rST:

``reStructuredText (rST)``
    A simple, yet powerful markup language for creating .html, or LaTeX output files.
    See the `rST primer`_.

.. _`root`:
.. _`root node`:

``Root``
    - The first node_ of a .leo file.
    - The first node of an `@root`_ tree or `@file`_ tree.

.. _`rst3 plugin`:

``rST plugin``
    A plugin_ that supports reStructuredText_.
    Unlike previous rst plugins, the rst3 plugin supports per-node options.

.. _`scope`:

``Scope``
    The portion of the outline_ in which a `section definition`_ is known.

.. _`section`:
.. _`sections`:

``Section``
    A fragment of text that can be incorporated into `derived files`_.
    See the `Quick start for programmers`_ in `Leo's tutorial`_ for more details.

.. _`section definition`:
.. _`section definitions`:

``Section definition``:
    The `body text`_ of a `section definition node`_.
    See the `Quick start for programmers`_ in `Leo's tutorial`_ for more details.

.. _`section definition node`:
.. _`section definition nodes`:

``Section definition node``
    A node_ whose headline_ starts with a `section name`_ and whose body text defines a section_.
    See the `Quick start for programmers`_ in `Leo's tutorial`_ for more details.

.. _`section name`:
.. _`section names`:

``Section name``
    A name enclosed in ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;``.
    Section names may contain any characters except newlines and "&gt;&gt;".
    See the `Quick start for programmers`_ in `Leo's tutorial`_ for more details.

.. _`section reference`:
.. _`section references`:
.. _`reference`:
.. _`references`:
.. _`referenced`:

``Section reference``

.. _`sentinel`:
.. _`sentinels`:
.. _`sentinel lines`:

``Sentinels, sentinel lines``
    Comment lines in files derived from `@file nodes`_.
    Such lines start with an ``@`` following the opening comment delimiter.
    Sentinels embed outline structure into `derived files`_.
    **Do not alter sentinel lines**.  Doing so can corrupt the outline structure.
    For more information see `Sentinel lines`_ in `Leo's tutorial`_.

.. _`@settings`:
.. _`setting`:
.. _`settings`:

``Setting``:
    Plugins_ and other parts of Leo can get options from ``@settings`` trees,
    outlines_ whose headline_ is ``@settings``. When opening a .leo file, Leo looks
    for ``@settings`` trees in the outline being opened and also in various
    ``leoSettings.leo files``. ``@settings`` trees allow plugins_ to get options without
    any further support from Leo's core code. For a full discussion of
    @settings trees, see `Chapter 8: Customizing Leo`_.

.. _`sibling`:
.. _`siblings`:

``Sibling``
    Two nodes_ are siblings if they have the same parent_.  Siblings of the root_ have no parent.

.. _`tangle`:
.. _`tangles`:
.. _`tangling`:

``Tangling``
    The process of creating `derived files`_ from `@root trees`_ or `@file trees`_.
    Leo tangles `@file trees`_ automatically when writing a .leo file.
    You must explicitly tangle_ `@root trees`_ using the ``Tangle`` command.
    Tangling expands all `section references` in an `@root node`_ or `@file node`_.
    For more information, see `Tangling @root trees`_ in Leo's `programming reference`_.

.. _`target language`:

``Tree``
    An outline_.
    A node_ and its descendants_.

.. _`untangle`:
.. _`untangles`:
.. _`untangling`:

``Untangling``
    Updating an outline_ based on changes to `derived files`_.
    Untangling allows changes to be propagated from derived files back to the outline.
    Especially useful when fixing syntax errors outside Leo.
    For more information, see `Untangling @root trees`_ in Leo's `programming reference`_.

.. _`weave`:
.. _`weaves`:
.. _`weaving`:

.. _`view node`:
.. _`view nodes`:

``View node``
    A `node`_ that represents a view of an `outline`_.
    View nodes are typically ordinary, non-`cloned`_ nodes that contain cloned `descendant`_ nodes.
    The cloned descendant nodes comprise most of the data of the view.
    Other non-cloned nodes may add additional information to the view.
    See `clones &amp; views`_ in the `Leo's tutorial`_ for more information.

``Weaving``
    The process of creating typeset documentation from a noweb_ or CWEB_ source file.
    Weaving creates documentation. Tangling_ creates `derived files`_.
    Leo does not support weaving directly.
    To weave a file you can create noweb_ or CWEB_ files using Leo's ``Export`` commands,
    then use the noweb_ or CWEB_ systems to weave those files.</t>

Chapter 11: White Papers
##########################

I wrote the first two white papers soon after discovering Python.
The conclusions in these papers have remained largely unchanged.
I wrote the third in November 2004, and rewrote it in February 2006.

<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.2">What struck me first as I converted C++ code to Python is how much less blah,
blah, blah there is in Python. No braces, no stupid semicolons and most
importantly, *no declarations*. No more pointless distinctions between
``const``, ``char *``, ``char const *``, ``char *`` and ``wxString``.
No more wondering whether a variable should be ``signed``, ``unsigned``, ``short`` or ``long``.

Declarations add clutter, declarations are never obviously right and
declarations don't prevent memory allocation tragedies. Declarations also hinder
prototyping. In C++, if I change the type of something I must change all related
declarations; this can be a huge and dangerous task. With Python, I can change
the type of an object without changing the code at all! It's no accident that
Leo's new log pane was created first in Python.

Functions returning tuples are a "minor" feature with a huge impact on code
clarity. No more passing pointers to data, no more defining (and allocating and
deallocating) temporary structs to hold multiple values.

Python can't check declarations because there aren't any. However, there is a
really nifty tool called Pychecker that does many of the checks typically done
by compilers. See `pychecker`_ for details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.3">Python is much more powerful than C++, not because Python has more features, but
because Python needs *less* features. Some examples:

-   Python does everything that the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) does,
    without any of the blah, blah, blah needed by STL.
    No fuss, no muss, no code bloat.

-   Python's slicing mechanism is very powerful and applies to any sequence (string, list or tuple).
    Python's string library does more with far less functions because slices replace many functions
    typically found in other string libraries.

-   Writing dict = {} creates a dictionary (hash table).
    Hash tables can contain anything, including lists and other hash tables.

-   Python's special functions,  ``__init__``, ``__del__``, ``__repr__``, ``__cmp__``, etc.
    are an elegant way to handle any special need that might arise.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.4">Before using Python I never fully realized how difficult and dangerous memory allocation is in C++.
Try doing::

        aList[i:j] = list(aString)

in C.  You will write about 20 lines of C code.
Any error in this code will create a memory allocation crash or leak.

Python is fundamentally safe. C++ is fundamentally unsafe. When I am using
Python I am free from worry and anxiety. When I am using C++ I must be
constantly "on guard." A momentary lapse can create a hard-to-find pointer bug.
With Python, almost nothing serious can ever go wrong, so I can work late at
night, or after a beer. The Python debugger is always available. If an exception
occurs, the debugger/interpreter tells me just what went wrong. I don't have to
plan a debugging strategy! Finally, Python recovers from exceptions, so Leo can
keep right on going even after a crash!</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.5">Python has almost all the speed of C. Other interpretive environments such as
icon and Smalltalk have clarity, power and safety similar to Python. What makes
Python unique is its seamless way of making C code look like Python code.
Python executes at essentially the speed of C code because most Python modules
are written in C. The overhead in calling such modules is negligible. Moreover,
if code is too slow, one can always create a C module to do the job.

In fact, Python encourages optimization by moving to higher levels of
expression. For example, Leo's Open command reads an XML file. If this command
is too slow I can use Python's XML parser module. This will speed up Leo while
at the same time raising the level of the code.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901092232.6">Little of Python is completely new. What stands out is the superb engineering
judgment evident in Python's design. Python is extremely powerful, yet small,
simple and elegant. Python allows me to express my intentions clearly and at the
highest possible level.

The only hope of making Leo all it can be is to use the best possible tools. I
believe Python (possibly with Tkinter) will allow me to add, at long last, the
new features that Leo should have.

Edward K. Ream, October 25, 2001.  P.S., September, 2005:

Four years of experience have only added to my admiration for Python. Leo could
not possibly be what it is today without Python.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050901174937">You can run Leo from a Python interpreter as follows::

	import leo
	leo.run() # runs Leo, opening a new outline.
	leo.go() # runs Leo after reloading all modules.
	leo.leoOpen(fileName) # runs Leo, reloads all modules, and opens fileName.

Here are some tips that may make running Leo easier:

**Linux**
    The following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo::
    
        #!/bin/sh 
        python &lt;leopath&gt;/leo.py $1
    
    where &lt;leopath&gt; is replaced with the path to the leo directory. 

**Windows**
    If you have `associated .leo files with Leo`_ you may run Leo by double-clicking any .leo file.
    You can also use a batch file.
    Put the following .bat file in c:\\Windows::

        cd c:\prog\LeoCVS\leo
        c:\python22\python c:\prog\LeoCVS\leo\leo.py %1
    
    This opens the file specified by the first argument (%1).

The first time you start Leo, a dialog will ask you for a unique identifier. If
you are using cvs, use your cvs login name. Otherwise your initials will do. Leo
stores this identifier in the file ``.leoID.txt``. Leo attempts to create
``leoID.txt`` in your home directory, then in Leo's config directory, and
finally in Leo's src directory. You can change this identifier at any time by
editing ``.leoID.txt``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050901184158">You can execute all the code in this file. Just select the code you want to
execute and run the Execute Script command.

**Important**: Python is finicky about indentation, so you must be careful to
select the leading whitespace of the first line.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902073404">Understanding this section is *essential*.
By default, all iterators discussed below use a *single* position to move
through the outline. This is a vital optimization; otherwise Leo would generate
one or more position object for each node of a tree traversal. However, it means
that it is *useless* to try to capture a position with::

    p2 = p  # Wrong.  p2 will change after this assignment.

Instead, scripts and plugins should use ``p.copy()`` to 'capture' the value of a position::

    p2 = p.copy()   # Correct: p2 will not change when p changes later.

Another way to solve this problem is to set ``copy=True`` when using an iterator::

    d = {}
    for p in c.allNodes_iter(copy=True):
        d[p.v.t] = p

This creates a dictionary of (unchanging!) positions, indexed via tnode.
**Warning** The positions in this dictionary will become invalid when the
outline's structure changes. It would be wrong to save a dictionary like this
for use between commands.

Setting the ``copy=True`` argument to iterators is an acceptable strategy for
infrequently used scripts; it is not acceptable for heavily used code in Leo's
core: it would create huge numbers of positions that would immediately be
candidates for garbage collection.

**Important**: 'Confused' scripts work because the ``position`` methods that
simulate the old ``vnode`` methods automatically create copies of positions when
'moving' through an outline. Thus, confused scripts generate many more positions
than would the equivalent script that uses ``position`` iterators. Such is the
price of compatibility.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050902100834">This following information may be of interest to historians. It is not of
general enough interest to put in Leo's Users Guide on the web. I am including
this mass of detail here to indicate the complexities that were involved in
designing Leo's simple-looking mechanisms.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852">Leo grew out of my efforts to use Donald Knuth's "CWEB system of Structured
documentation." I had known of literate programming since the mid 1980's, but I
never understood how to make it work for me. In November 1995 I started thinking
about literate programming in earnest. Over the holidays I mused about making
literate programs more understandable. In January 1996 the fog of confusion
suddenly cleared. I summarized my thinking with the phrase, **web are outlines
in disguise**. I suspected that outline views were the key to literate
programming, but many details remained obscure.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.1">March 5, 1996, is the most important date in Leo's history. While returning from
a day of skiing, I discussed my thoughts with Rebecca. During that conversation
I realized that I could use the ``MORE`` outliner as a prototype for a "literate
outliner." I immediately started work on my first literate outline. It quickly
became apparent that outlines work: all my old problems with literate
programming vanished. The ``@others`` directive dates from this day. I realized
that ``MORE``'s outlines could form the basis for Leo's screen design. Rather
than opening body text within the outline, as ``MORE`` does, I decided to use a
separate body pane.

I hacked a translator called ``M2C`` which allowed me to use ``MORE`` to write
real code. I would write code in ``MORE``, copy the text to the clipboard in
``MORE`` format, then run ``M2C``, which would tangle the outline into C code.
This process was useful, if clumsy. I called the language used in the outline
``SWEB``, for simplified ``CWEB``. Much later Leo started supporting the noweb
language.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.2">Throughout 1996 I created a version of Leo on the Macintosh in plain C and the
native Mac Toolbox. This was a poor choice; I wasted a huge amount of time
programming with these primitive tools. However, this effort convinced me that
Leo was a great way to program.

Late in 1997 I wrote a ``Print`` command to typeset an outline. Printing (Weaving)
is supposedly a key feature of literate programming. Imagine my surprise when I
realized that such a "beautiful" program listing was almost unintelligible; all
the structure inherent in the outline was lost! I saw clearly that typesetting,
no matter how well done, is no substitute for explicit structure.

In 1998 I created a version of Leo using Apple's YellowBox environment. Alas,
Apple broke its promises to Apple developers. I had to start again.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.3">I rewrote Leo for Borland C++ starting in May 1999. Borland C++ was much better
than CodeWarrior C, but it was still C++. This version of Leo was the first
version to use xml as the format of .leo files. The last version of Borland Leo,
3.12 Final went out the door July 17, 2003.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.4">I attended the Python conference in early 2001. In May of 2000 I began work on
an wxWindows version of Leo. This did not work out, but something good did come
from this effort. I spent a lot of time adding Python scripting to the wxWindows
code and I became familiar with Python and its internals.

I really started to 'get' Python in September 2001. I wrote the white papers at
about this time. Python solved *all* my programming problems. I rewrote Leo in
Python in about two months! For the first time in my career I was no longer
anxious while programming; it simply isn't possible to create bad bugs in
Python. The Python version of Leo was the first officially OpenSoftware version of
Leo. The first functional version of Leo in Python was 0.05 alpha, December 17,
2001.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.5">I registered the Leo project on SourceForge on March 10, 2003. It is certainly
no accident that Leo started a new life shortly thereafter. Prior to SourceForge
my interest in Leo had been waning.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.6">In the summer of 2001 I began to consider using sentinel lines in derived files.
Previously I had thought that outline structure must be 'protected' by remaining
inside .leo files. Accepting the possibility that sentinels might be corrupted
opened vast new design possibilities. In retrospect, problems with sentinel
almost never happen, but that wasn't obvious at the time! The result of this
design was known at first as ``Leo2``. That terminology is extinct. I think of
this version as the first version to support ``@file`` and automatic tangling
and untangling.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.7">The biggest surprise in Leo's history was the realization it is **much** easier
to untangle files derived from ``@file``. Indeed, ``@root`` creates all sorts of
problems that just disappear when using ``@file``. The new Python version of Leo
became fully operational in early 2002. It was probably about this time that I chose
noweb as Leo's preferred markup language. My decision not to support noweb's
escape sequences made Leo's read code much more robust.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.8">I spent 2002 taking advantages of Python's tremendous power and safety.
Many improvements were at last easy enough to do:

- Nested ``@others`` directives appeared in 3.2.
- Unicode support started in 3.3.
- @first and @last appeared in 3.7
- @asis and @nosent appeared in 3.8.
- Incremental syntax coloring and incremental undo appeared in 3.9.
- Paul Paterson created Leo's plugin architecture sometime during this period.
  Plugins have been a driving force in Leo's development because people can
  change how Leo works without altering Leo's core.
- 3.12 fixed a huge memory leak.
- 3.12 Final, the last 3.x version, appeared July 17, 2003.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.9">In late 2002 and throughout 2003 I worked on an entirely new file format.
4.0 final went out the door October 17, 2003 after almost a year intense
design work trying to improve error recovery scheme used while reading
derived files. In the summer of 2003 I realized that orphan and ``@ignore``'d
nodes must be prohibited in ``@file`` trees. With this restriction, Leo
could finally recreate ``@file`` trees in outlines using **only** the
information in derived files. This made the read code much more robust, and
eliminated all the previous unworkable error recovery schemes. At last Leo
was on a completely firm foundation.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.10">Leo first used gnx's (global node indices) as a foolproof way of associating
nodes in .leo files with nodes in derived files. At the time, there was
still intense discussions about protecting the logical consistency of
outlines. ``@thin`` was later to solve all those problems, but nobody knew
that then.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.11">Leo 4.2 Final went out the door September 20, 2004.
This surely is one of the most significant dates in Leo's history:

-   This marked the end worries about consistency of outlines and derived files:
    Leo recreates all essential information from thin derived files,
    so *there is nothing left in the .leo file to get out of synch*.

-   Thin derived files use gnx's extensively.  This simplifies the file format and makes thin derived files
    more cvs friendly.

-   A sensational scripting plugin showed how to create script buttons.
    This has lead to improvements in the Execute Script command and
    other significant improvements in Unit testing.

-   As if this were not enough, 4.2 marked the 'great divide' in Leo's internal
    data structures. Before 4.2, Leo every node in the outline had its own
    ``vnode``. This was a big performance problem: clone operations had to
    traverse the entire outline! 4.2 represents clones by sharing subtrees.
    Changing Leo's fundamental data structures while retaining compatibility
    with old scripts was engineering work of which the entire Leo community can
    be proud. `Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python`_ tells how the position
    class makes this happen.
    This was a cooperative effort. Kent Tenney and Bernhard Mulder made
    absolutely crucial contributions. Kent pointed out that it is a ``tnode``,
    not a ``vnode`` that must form the root of the shared data. Bernhard showed
    that iterators are the way to avoid creating huge numbers of positions.

Leo 4.2 marked so many significant changes. I often find it hard to remember
what life with Leo was like before it.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902105852.12">Leo 4.3 corrected many problems with ``leoConfig.txt``. Instead, Leo gets
settings from one or more ``leoSettings.leo files``. This version also
introduced a way to changed settings using a settings dialog.  However,
the settings dialog proved not to be useful (worse, it inhibited design) and
the settings dialog was retired in Leo 4.4.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050902160924">**Important**: Script buttons are easier to use than the script-oriented
find/change commands described next. I recommend using script buttons whenever
possible. See `Creating script buttons`_.
You are not likely to need all the firepower that script-orient find/change commands,
but it could save you lots of time for complex jobs.

Leo's find panel contains the ``Script Search`` radio button and the ``Script
Change`` checkbox. When the ``Script Search`` radio button is selected Leo treats the
contents of the ``Search Text`` as a script to execute whenever any kind of Find
command is executed. Similarly, when the ``Script Change`` checkbox is selected Leo
treats the context of the ``Change Text`` as a script to execute whenever any kind
of Change command is executed.

Script-based find-change turns Leo's Find/Change panel into a platform for
running scripts interactively. The script writer need not write code to control
interactive searches.

Here's how it works. Leo dedicates ``g.app.searchDict`` for
communication between Leo and the search and change scripts. The search and
change scripts may also use ``g.app.searchDict`` for communication between themselves.
Leo sets ``g.app.searchDict["type"]`` to "find", "change", "findAll" or "changeAll" to
indicate the kind of command being executed. Scripts may use all other entries
in ``g.app.searchDict`` as they please.

Here is what Leo does when the user presses buttons with ``Script Search`` enable:

``Find and Change, then Find`` buttons
    Leo executes the find script once. Typically, the find script would traverse
    the tree and highlight the found text or otherwise indicate to the user that
    the find operation has succeeded. However, the script can do anything it
    pleases.

``Find All`` button
    Leo executes the find script repeatedly until ``g.app.searchDict["continue"]`` evaluates
    to ``False``. Initially there is no entry for ``g.app.searchDict["continue"]``, so the
    find script must set ``g.app.searchDict["continue"] = True`` if it wants Leo call it again.

``Change`` button
    Leo executes the change script once. Typically, the change script would change
    the selected text. Usually the change script will compute the new value of body
    text and call ``c.setBodyString(p,newText)`` to make that change permanent. 
    To handle undo, the change script can call
    ``c.frame.onBodyChanged(v,"Change",oldText=oldText)``.

``Change All`` button
    Leo executes the change script repeatedly
    until g.app.searchDict["continue"] evaluates to false.

Most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find Panel like "whole
word", "pattern match", and "reverse". However, these settings are available to
the scripts via ivars such as ``c.whole_word_flag``, etc. if desired.

The ``initScriptFind`` script in ``LeoPy.leo`` makes it easy to set up script based searches:

1. Put the following code in the root of a tree that will contain your script search::

    # Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
    import leoGlobals as g.
    g.initScriptFind("Find script","Change script") # Second argument is optional.
    # Start searching at the top.
    c.selectPosition(c.rootPosition())

2. Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes).

3. (Optional) Put the change script in a child node called "Change script"

4.  Execute the code above.  Leo does the following:

- Puts the body of the "Find script" into the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Puts the body of the "Change script" into the change text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.
- Selects the Script Find radio button.
- Selects the Script Change checkbox if the change script exists.
- Selects the root of the entire outline.

Presto! Leo is ready for a script search. **Note**: you could also consider creating a
script button to set up complex find/change scripts.

Here are some ideas for using script find/change.
	
-   Find and change scripts may use Python's re module.  For
    example, the find script could set ``g.app.searchDict["m"]`` to the match object
    returned by re's match method.  The change script would then compute the
    result, change the text and set the undo info as usual.
    
-   Find and change scripts may operate on data outside any Leo outline.
    For example, script-find scripts could traverse your file system.
    Scripts could even pull data from the file system
    into the outline so that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts
    operate.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833">Plugins and other scripts can register event handlers (also known as hooks) with code such as::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("after-create-leo-frame",onCreate)
    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle) 
    leoPlugins.registerHandler(("start2","open2","command2"), create_open_with_menu) 

As shown above, a plugin may register one or more event handlers with a single call to
``leoPlugins.registerHandler``. Once a hook is registered, Leo will call the
registered function' at the named **hook time**. For example::

    leoPlugins.registerHandler("idle", on_idle)

causes Leo to call ``on_idle`` at "idle" time.

Event handlers must have the following signature::

    def myHook (tag, keywords):
        whatever

-   ``tag`` is the name of the hook (a string).
-   ``keywords`` is a Python dictionary containing additional information.
    The following section describes the contents of the ``keywords`` dictionary in detail.

**Important**: hooks should get the proper commander this way::

    c = keywords.get('c')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903074833.1">The following table tells about each event handler: its name, when it is called,
and the additional arguments passed to the hook in the ``keywords`` dictionary.
For some kind of hooks, Leo will skip its own normal processing if the hook
returns anything *other* than None. The table indicates such hooks with 'yes' in
the 'Stop?' column.

**Important**: Ever since Leo 4.2, the ``v``, ``old_v`` and ``new_v`` keys in
the keyword dictionary contain *positions*, not vnodes. These keys are
deprecated. The ``new_c`` key is also deprecated. Plugins should use the ``c`` key instead.

============================= ======== =================================== =============================

**Notes**:

1.  'activate' and 'deactivate' hooks have been removed because they do not work as expected.

2.  'commands' hooks: The label entry in the keywords dict contains the
    'canonicalized' form of the command, that is, the lowercase name of the command
    with all non-alphabetic characters removed.
    Commands hooks now set the label for undo and redo commands 'undo' and 'redo'
    rather than 'cantundo' and 'cantredo'.

3.  'menu1' hook: Setting ``g.app.realMenuNameDict`` in this hook is an easy way of
    translating menu names to other languages. **Note**: the 'new' names created this
    way affect only the actual spelling of the menu items, they do *not* affect how
    you specify shortcuts settings, nor do they affect the 'official'
    command names passed in ``g.app.commandName``. For example::

        app().realMenuNameDict['Open...'] = 'Ouvre'.

4.  'open1' and 'open2' hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing the following entries:

    - c:          The commander of the newly opened window.
    - old_c:      The commander of the previously open window.
    - new_c:      (deprecated: use 'c' instead) The commander of the newly opened window.
    - fileName:   The name of the file being opened.

    You can use ``old_c.currentPosition()`` and ``c.currentPosition()`` to get the current
    position in the old and new windows.
    Leo calls the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks only if the file is not already open. Leo
    will also call the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks if: a) a file is opened using the
    Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.

5.  '\@url1' and '\@url2' hooks are only executed if the 'icondclick1' hook returns None.

6.  These hooks are useful for testing.

7.  These hooks allow plugins to parse and handle markup within doc parts,
    comments and Python ``'''`` strings. Note that these hooks are *not* called in
    Python ``'''`` strings. See the color_markup plugin for a complete example of how to
    use these hooks.

8.  Leo calls the 'create-optional-menus' hook when creating menus. This hook need
    only create new menus in the correct order, without worrying about the placement
    of the menus in the menu bar. See the plugins_menu and scripts_menu plugins for
    examples of how to use this hook.

9.  The ``New`` command calls 'new'.
    The 'new_c' key is deprecated.  Use the 'c' key instead.

10. ``g.scanDirectives`` calls 'scan-directives' hook.
    ``g.scanDirectives`` returns a dictionary, say d.
    d.get('pluginsList') is an a list of tuples ``(d,v,s,k)`` where:

    - d is the spelling of the @directive, without the leading @.
    - v is the vnode containing the directive, _not_ the original vnode.
    - s[k:] is a string containing whatever follows the @directive.
      k has already been moved past any whitespace that follows the @directive.

    See the add_directives plugins directive for a complete example of how to use
    the 'scan-directives' hook.

11. ``g.app.closeLeoWindow`` calls the 'close-frame' hook just before
    removing the window from ``g.app.windowList``. The hook code may remove the window
    from ``app.windowList`` to prevent ``g.app.closeLeoWindow`` from destroying the window.

12. ``g.app.destroyAllGlobalWindows`` calls the 'destroy-all-global-windows' hook.
    This hook gives plugins the chance to clean up after themselves when Leo shuts down.

13. New in Leo 4.4: Leo calls the 'headkey1' and 'headkey2' hooks only when the user completes
    the editing of a headline, and ch is always '\r', regardless of platform.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903075144">A **plugin** is a Python file that appears in Leo's plugin directory. Plugins
modify how Leo works. With plugins you can give Leo new commands, modify how
existing commands work, or change any other aspect of Leo's look and feel.
``leoPlugins.leo`` contains all of Leo's official plugins. Studying this file is
a good way to learn how to write plugins.

You **enable** plugins using @enabled-plugins nodes in leoSettings.leo or
myLeoSettings.leo. For more details, see the @enabled-plugins node in
leoSettings.leo. Leo imports all enabled plugins at startup time. Plugins become
**active** if importing the plugin was successful.

Writing plugins is quite similar to writing any other Leo script.  See
`Chapter 7\: Scripting Leo with Python`_. In particular:
    
1. Plugins can use any of Leo's source code simply by importing any module
   defined in leoPy.leo.

2. Plugins can register event handlers just like any other Leo script. For full
   details, see the section called `event handlers`_ in Leo's scripting chapter.
   
The rest of this chapters discusses topics related specifically to plugins.

<t tx="ekr.20050903161843">Creating a script button should be your first thought whenever you want to
automate any task. The scripting plugin, ``mod_scripting.py``, puts two buttons
in the icon menu, a pink ``Run Script`` button and a yellow ``Script Button``
button. The ``Run Script`` button does the same thing as the ``Execute Script``
command. The ``Script Button`` button is the interesting one. It creates a
button, confusingly called a **script button** in the icon area. A script button
executes a script when you push it.

Suppose node N is selected. When you press the ``Script Button`` button a new
(pink) script button is created. The name of the new button is N's headline
text. The script associated with the new button is N's body text. Now whenever
you press the new button, N's script is executed on the **presently** selected
node. Script buttons are extraordinarily useful. In effect, each script button
defines an instant command! For example, sometimes my fingers get tired of
saving a file. I simply put ``Save`` in a node's headline and ``c.save()`` in
the body text. I hit the ``Script Button`` button and I get a new button called
``Save`` that will save the outline when I press it.

Here's a more interesting example. The following script searches the present node
and its ancestors looking for an ``@rst`` node. When such a node is found the
script calls the `rst3 plugin`_ to format it. I don't have to select the actual
``@rst`` node; I can select any of its children::

    import leoPlugins
    rst3 = leoPlugins.getPluginModule('rst3')
    if rst3: # already loaded.
        controller = rst3.controllers.get(c)
        if controller:
            for p in p.self_and_parents_iter():
                if p.headString().startswith('@rst '):
                    controller.processTree(p)
                    break
    else: # Just load the plugin.
        rst3 = leoPlugins.loadOnePlugin('rst3',verbose=True)
        if rst3:
            g.es('rst3 loaded')
            rst3.onCreate('tag',{'c':c})
        else:
            # Ask to be removed.
            g.app.scriptDict['removeMe'] = True

**Notes**:

-   The scripting plugin pre-defines the ``c``, ``g`` and ``p`` symbols
    just as the ``Execute Script`` command does.

-   By default a script button executes the **present** body text of the node that original created the script button.
    This is very handy: you can modify a script button's script at any time without having to recreate the script button.

-   You can delete any script button by right-clicking on it.

-   On startup, the scripting plugin scans the entire .leo file and creates a script button
    for every node whose headline starts with ``@button scriptName``.
    **Warning**: this is indeed a security risk of the kind discussed later.
    This feature can be disabled by setting ``atButtonNodes = True`` at the start of ``mod_scripting.py``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050903174637">There are many problems with pdf at present.

@ignore</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906090012">Leo (and other programs) often send more detailed error messages to ``stderr``,
the output stream that goes to the console window. In Linux and MacOS
environments, python programs normally execute with the console window visible.
On Windows, can run Leo with the console window visible by associating .leo
files with ``python.exe`` *not* ``pythonw.exe``. For full instructions about how
to do this, see `Associating Leo with .leo Files`_.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104918">Leo 4.3.2 beta 1                  September 10, 2005

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of 4.3.2:
-----------------------

- Improved Leo's documentation:
    - A tutorial introduction to Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html
    - A 5-minute guide to programming with Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#quick-start-for-programmers

- The new rst3 plugin creates .html and .tex files from reStructuredText
  embedded in Leo files. Any node of the source outline may contain options for
  the rst3 plugin, which makes this plugin much more useful and flexible than
  the previous rst plugins. All of Leo's documentation was created using this
  plugin from sources in LeoDocs.leo. For full documentation for rst3 see:
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html.

- The spellpyx (spell checking) plugin is now much easier to use.

- The vim and openWith plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present.
 
- Improved the Pretty Printing command.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050906104918.1">Here is a summary of the changes:

- General:  All chapters created with rst3 plugin.  This ensures a uniform look.  The source is in LeoDocs.leo.  Removed all references to older versions of Leo, except when discussing old file formats in the Appendices.  Corrected all text so it discusses present version.

- rst3 plugin itself:  Correct bug that caused chapters to be formatted differently when processing multiple @rst trees.  

- rst3 button in LeoDocs.leo:  The script first looks *up* the tree, looking for an @rst node.  If found, it processes just that tree.  If not found, it processes all @rst nodes *below* the originally selected node.  The button is now much more convenient to use.

- Preface: Shorter, no history.  No longer a dead end.

- What People are Saying About Leo: No longer a dead end.

- FAQ: Reorganized, simplified, revised.  Added entries for running Leo in a console window and debugging docutils.  Improved entry for using cvs.

- Chapter 1: Installation: Now the first chapter.  Revised.

- Chapter 2: Tutorial: Completely rewritten.  Like Python's tutorial, this chapter contains everything a beginner needs to understand and use Leo.  The `Quickstart for programmers` section is the heart of this chapter.  All terms used have links either to their definition in the tutorial or in the Glossary.  Newbies should be able to digest this chapter easily.  This chapter should make Leo comprehensible to many more people.

- Chapter 3: Using Outlines: Revised per general remarks above.

- Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo.  Completely rewritten.  The old chapter was an embarrassment. The new chapter is a reference guide, properly organized as such.  The introduction warns newbies away.

- Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands.  'Minor' revisions and corrections create a substantially better result.

- Chapter 6: Leo and literate programming: Reformatting helps.  New words about rST markup and other improvements over traditional LP.

- Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python: Rewritten, simplified, updated and corrected.  The sources in LeoDocs.leo are directly executable.  rST sources use literal blocks instead of code-blocks so that the sources are simplified. (Important when executing examples).  Properly discusses positions, including 'supremely important' section on copying positions.

- Chapter 8: Customizing Leo.  Heavily revised.  Discusses leoSettings.leo, not leoConfig.txt.  Security warnings are more reasonable.  Section on script buttons. Rewrote section on uA's (Adding extensible attributes to nodes and .leo files).

- Chapter 9: History of Leo.  Rewritten.  Much shorter and more useful.  Discusses the major milestones, concentrating on explaining the major differences between versions.  Gone are details of how discoveries came to be.  They are in LeoPostings.leo, which will be included in the distribution.

- Chapter 10: Theory of Operation.  Largely rewritten.  Discusses positions properly.  Omits discussion of how clones were implemented before 4.2.

- Chapter 11: White Papers.  A new chapter.  This is a slightly-edited version of writing that had been buried in the appendices.

- Appendices.  Heavily revised and reformatted.  Rewrote sections on file formats.

- Glossary: A separate chapter.  All terms have links to their definition.  All definitions are rST targets so other chapters may refer to them.  Added several new entries.

<t tx="ekr.20050907094633">Any .leo file may contain an ``@settings`` tree, so settings may be different for each commander.
Plugins and other scripts can get the value of settings as follows::

    format_headlines = c.config.getBool('rst3_format_headlines')
    g.es('format_headlines',format_headlines)

The ``c.config`` class has the following getters.
See the ``configSettings`` in ``leoCommands.py`` for details::

    getBool
    getColor
    getDirectory
    getFloat
    getInt
    getLanguage
    getRatio
    getShortcut
    getString

You can set any *existing* item in an ``@settings`` tree with ``c.config.set(p,setting,val)``.
For example::

    for val in (False,True):
        c.config.set(p,'rst3_format_headlines',val)
        format_headlines = c.config.getBool('rst3_format_headlines')
        g.es('format_headlines',format_headlines)

``c.config.set`` does not change the ``@settings`` tree; it simply changes the values returned by the getters.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050908113904">This is a known bug in Tk that prevents this on Windows. The obvious Tk code
causes a hard crash in the Python dll: it's the only time Leo has taken such a
hard crash. The ``UniversalScrolling`` plugin is an attempt at a workaround.

Scrolling with the mouse wheel may be possible on Linux. See the code in
createTkTreeCanvas in leoTkinterFrame.py

<t tx="ekr.20050908164150.1">See http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation
of this plugin.

The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text formatting
markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any text).

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The
Write Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for rst
root nodes whose headline have the form @rst &lt;filename&gt;. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050908164150.2">This plugin now allows quotes within words, but strips quotes and other cruft
from the beginning and end of words. As a result, using the spellpyx spell
checker is much easier than before.

Leo's extensions folder now contains aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd. These are
Python dll's compiled for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. You must rename one
of these files to be aspell.pyd and move aspell.pyd to the aspell folder. For
more details, see the installation nodes in the docstring for the spellpyx
plugin.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050910143326">These plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present. The
subprocess module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems, Leo will
use subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

For Windows systems you can install Python's subprocess module in Python 2.2 or
2.3 as follows:

Chapter 12: Plugins
##########################

This chapter discusses the plugins contained in leoPlugins.leo.
These plugins are part of Leo's official distribution.
`Chapter 13: Writing Plugins`_ tells how to write plugins.

The scripting plugin (``mod_scripting.py``) deserves special mention. This
plugin lets you create **script buttons** in a matter of seconds. See `Creating
script buttons`_. Script buttons are extraordinarily useful. Try them, you'll be
instantly hooked.

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.28">This plugin adds a menu item under the File-&gt;Import menu to import
Cisco configuration files.
The plugin will:

1)  Create a new node, under the current node, where the configuration will be
    written. This node will typically have references to several sections (see below).

2)  Create sections (child nodes) for the indented blocks present in the original
    config file. These child nodes will have sub-nodes grouping similar blocks (e.g.
    there will be an 'interface' child node, with as many sub-nodes as there are real
    interfaces in the configuration file).

3)  Create sections for the custom keywords specified in the customBlocks[] list in
    importCiscoConfig(). You can modify this list to specify different keywords. DO
    NOT put keywords that are followed by indented blocks (these are taken care of by
    point 2 above). The negated form of the keywords (for example, if the keyword is
    'service', the negated form is 'no service') is also included in the sections.
    
    
4)  Not display consecutive empty comment lines (lines with only a '!').

All created sections are alphabetically ordered.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.82">Supports new Leo directives.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.85">This plugin manages BibTeX files with Leo. Create a bibliographic database by
putting ``@bibtex filename`` in a headline. Entries are added as nodes, with
``@entrytype key`` as the headline, and the contents of the entry in body text.
The plugin will automatically insert a template for the entry in the body pane
when a new entry is created (hooked to pressing enter when typing the headline
text). The templates are defined in dictionary ``templates`` in the \&lt;\&lt;globals\&gt;\&gt;
section, by default containing all required fields for every entry.

The file is written by double-clicking the node. Thus the following outline::

    -@bibtex biblio.bib
     +@book key
      author = {A. Uthor},
      year = 1999

will be written in the file 'biblio.bib' as::

    @book{key,
    author = {A. Uthor},
    year= 1999}

Strings are defined in ``@string`` nodes and they can contain multiple entries.
All ``@string`` nodes are written at the start of the file. Thus the following
outline::

    -@bibtext biblio.bib
     +@string
      j1 = {Journal}
     +@article AUj1
      author = {A. Uthor},
      journal = j1
     +@string
      j2 = {Journal2}
      j3 = {Journal3}
    
Will be written as::

    @string{j1 = {Journal1}}
    @string{j2 = {Journal2}}
    @string{j3 = {Journal3}}
    
    @article{AUj1,
    author = {A. Uthor},
    journal = j1}

No error checking is made on the syntax. The entries can be organised under
nodes--if the headline doesn't start with '@', the headline and body text are
ignored, but the child nodes are parsed as usual. BibTeX files can be imported
by creating an empty node with ``@bibtex filename`` in the headline.
Double-clicking it will read the file ``filename`` and parse it into a
``@bibtex`` tree. No syntax checking is made, ``filename`` is expected to be a
valid BibTeX file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.98">This plugin is enhances the EditAttributes.py plugin. It puts a command in
Outline called ConceptualSort. This will prompt you for a concept to sort by.
This gives the user some more flexibility in how they want to arrange their
nodes. Nodes without the attribute in question go to the bottom of the sort.
The user can:

- Select which attribute he wants to sort on by clicking on the Attribute box.

- Select the type of sort he wants by clicking on the radio buttons:

    -   Normal.
    -   Reversed. Like normal but the results are reversed.
    -   Used defined. For advanced users. The text box is where a user can type in
        their own python code to sort the nodes-attributes. There is no need for a
        def. That gets appended to the beginning of the code. It prototype looks
        like::

            def( a, b, att ):

where a and b are nodes and att is dictionary of the nodes and the respective
value of the selected attribute. There is no need to indent on the first level
since indentation is added at compile time.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.113">Leo plugin that permits the definition of actions for double-clicking on file
nodes. Double-clicking in a ``@file`` node writes out the file if changes have
been made since the last save, and then runs a script on it, which is retrieved
from the outline. Scripts are located in a node whose headline is FileActions.
This node can be anywhere in the outline. If there is more than one such node,
the first one in outline order is used. The children of that node are expected
to contain a file pattern in the headline and the script to be executed in the
body. The file name is matched against the patterns (which are Unix-style shell
patterns), and the first matching node is selected. If the filename is a path,
only the last item is matched. Execution of the scripts is similar to the
``Execute Script`` command in Leo. The main difference is that the namespace in
which the scripts are run contains two elements:

-   ``filename``, which contains the filename from the ``@file`` directive.

-   ``shellScriptInWindow``, a utility function that runs
    a shell script in an external windows, thus permitting
    programs to be called that require user interaction

File actions are implemented for ``@file`` nodes and all its variants
(``@file-nosent``, ``@thin``, etc.). There is also a new node type
``@file-ref`` for referring to files purely for the purpose of
file actions, Leo does not do anything with or to such files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.129">A Leo Plugin that adds Group commands functionality.  Restrictions currently apply to using Leo with a Tk front end.
There are several commands in this plugin:

-   Mark Node: marks a node for further operations such as copying, cloning and moving.

-   Mark Spot: marks a node as the place where group operations are to target.

-   Operate On Marked: moves lassoed nodes to the spot where the roundup node is
    placed. Clones are maintained.

-   Clear Marked: unmarks all marked nodes and removes the roundup node.

-   Transfer Lassoed Nodes: this is a menu for inter-window communication.
    The windows must all be spawned from the same Leo instance. 
    It allows the user to move all node marked for copying and moving from another window to this one.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.164">Creates new nodes containing parameterized section references.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.172">This plugin allows Leo to read a complete directory's outline into a Leo's
Outline. Directories are converted into headlines and files names are listed
into the bodies.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.184">Timestamp all save operations to show when they occur.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.186">Modify the way exported outlines are displayed.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.188">A plugin that helps customize pretty printing. It creates a do-nothing subclass
of the default pretty printer. To customize, simply override in this file the
methods of the base prettyPrinter class in leoCommands.py. You would typically
want to override putNormalToken or its allies. Templates for these methods have
been provided. You may, however, override any methods you like. You could even
define your own class entirely, provided you implement the prettyPrintNode
method.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.204">A plugin to schedule commands for later execution. It's provides the ability to
issue commands at a future time and to write messages that will be displayed at
a later time. To record commands You goto Schedule and choose begin recording.
Then you jump to the nodes and select the commands you want issued on them. This
process is ended with the end recording option. A dialog pops up. You can then
click on the individual commands and set the time for execution. To set the
execution time for all, enter a value and hit set_all. All times must be in the
form hh:mm. For example I want to issue a save command for 5:00 PM. I would do
so by using the value 17:00. The Schedule Message is simple. There is a Text box
to enter the message and a Entry to place the time. View Queue will summon a
view of The Queue. This dialog will show the commands that have been enqueued.
There is also the option to Cancel out any scheduled commands/messages.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.225">This plugin lets you add customizable templates to an outline. Templates are
like any other node except that the plugin replaces %s in the body text by
values that you specify when using template. Templates may have section
references; this plugin uses Leo's ``@nosent`` write machinery to create one
string out of possibly many nodes. This plugin requires the simplified atFile
write code that is new in 4.2.1.

This plugin creates two buttons in Leo's icon area:

- The '%s' button marks or unmarks a node as a template. A %s symbol will appear to
  the left of the node when it is marked as a template.

- The '----&gt; %s' button brings up a dialog that shows you the template text and
  asks you to specify the value for all %s instances. Dismissing this dialog
  inserts the template as the first child of the node, and creates a section
  reference in the node that references the template.

If a template does not have a '%s' in it, then the templates plugin just adds
the text as a node. Templates once marked are stored across sessions. Do not put
a template in a thin file, as your template mark will be erased between
sessions.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.245">This plugin adds **date nodes** (nodes with dates as their headlines) to the
current outline. Date nodes may be added one at a time, a month's-worth at a
time, or a year's-worth at a time. The format of the headlines is
configurable in the ini file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.273">A plugin to store Leo trees in anydbm files. Note: there isn't such a thing as an
anydbm file: it's whatever the anydbm module uses.
Under Outline, there is an option called ``Library``. This will open a
dialog with a list of the trees that you have saved. You can insert trees stored
in the library, remove them and add trees to the library. Be aware of unicode,
any characters outside of the ascii set gets turned into a ?. I found this
problem in storing some trees from Edward's Leo outline. Id like it to be able to
store unicode, but that may require a more specific db background, than anydbm.
Also note, that your library files may not be OS independent. If your python
distribution does not have the backing db on another machine, it will not be
able to open your library.
This should help people develop templates that they want to reuse between Leo
projects.  For example, Id like a template of many Java interfaces to be easily
accessible.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.314">Autosave the Leo document every so often. The time between saves is given in
seconds in autosave.ini.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.318">This plugin puts the View Table command in the Outline menu. This command checks
the current node using the csv (comma separated values) mods Sniffer. It tries
to determine the format that is in the nodes data. If you had excel data in it,
it should be able to determine its excel data. It then creates a dialog with the
data presented as in a table for the user to see it. Requires Pmw and the
tktable widget at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tktable.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.334"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.335">A plugin to test import problems.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.336">Dump Python globals at startup.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.338">Enable debugging and tracing for Python's garbage collector.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.341">Trace changes to Leo's objects at idle time.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.344">Trace keystrokes in the outline and body panes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.346">Trace the most common hooks, but not key, drag or idle hooks.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.363">The dyna_menu plugin is a remarkable body of work by 'e'.
This plugin creates a dyna_menu menu from which you can execute commands.
You may download the latest version at: http://rclick.netfirms.com/dyna_menu.py.html</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.525"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.526">Synchronizes ``@folder`` nodes with folders. If a node is named ``@folder
path_to_folder``, the content (filenames) of the folder and the children of that
node will be sync. Whenever a new file is put there, a new node will appear on
top of the children list (with mark). So that I can put my description (i.e.,
annotation) as the content of that node. In this way, I can find any files much
easier from leo. Moreover, I add another feature to allow you to group files(in
leo) into children of another group. This will help when there are many files in
that folder. You can logically group it in leo (or even clone it to many
groups), while keep every files in a flat/single directory on your computer.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.529">Executes commands in nodes whose body text starts with ``@produce``.
To use, put in the body text of a node::

    @produce javac -verbose Test.java

To execute, you goto Outline and look at Produce. Choose Execute All Produce or
Execute Tree Produce. The Tree does the current Tree, All does the whole
Outline. Executing will fire javac, or whatever your using. ``@produce`` functions
as a directive. After executing, a log file/node is created at the top of the
Outline. Any output, even error messages, should be there. It executes in a
hierarchal manner. Nodes that come before that contain ``@produce`` go first. I'm
hoping that this orthogonal to ``@run`` nodes and anything like that. Its not
intended as a replacement for make or Ant, but as a simple substitute when that
machinery is overkill. **Warning**: trying to execute a non-existent command
will hang Leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.540">A plugin that supports ``@clip``, ``@view`` and ``@strip`` nodes.

-   Selecting a headline containing ``@clip`` appends the contents of the clipboard to
    the end of the body pane.

-   Double clicking the icon box of a node whose headline contains ``@view &lt;path-to-file&gt;``
    places the contents of the file in the body pane.

-   Double clicking the icon box of a node whose headline contains ``@strip &lt;path-to-file&gt;``
    places the contents of the file in the body pane, with all sentinels removed.

This plugin also accumulates the effect of all ``@path`` nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.556">This plugin allows the user to import binary data and store it in Leo as a
base64 string. This plugin adds ``Import base64`` and ``Export base64`` commands
to the Import menu and adds the 'View base64' command to the outline menu. The
Import base64 command creates a new node with the headline::

    @base64 &lt;filename&gt;

The body of this node will kill the colorizer, add some info on the original
file and create a section reference to the payload node, which contains the
data. The Export base64 command asks for a location to place the file. The
plugin checks that the structure of the base64 node is what it expected,
basically what an import operation creates. If Ok, it will write the file to the
selected directory. The View base64 command brings up a Pmw Dialog that displays
the data as a PhotoImage. This currently only supports formats recognized by the
PhotoImage class. This would be the .gif format. This functionality may be
enhanced in the future by PIL to support more image types. Depending on the size
of the image, you may have to scroll around to see it. For example, a leo clone
icon will require scrolling to find. Id like to change this in the future.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.565">A Leo plugin that adds quick utility commands through a pop-up menu.
To summon Menu, type control-space.
To unsummon, Right Click.
    
1. Movement. If a node has ancestors,siblings or children a menu option will
appear offering the user the ability to jump to the node from the current node.
This is an improvement over moving one node at a time with the keyboard
commands.

2. Inserting text. These menus offer the current language keywords, the
directives the body recognizes and any ``@file`` type headline directives. It offers
the new user easy access to the different directives and ways to write a file.

3. Moving Nodes(experimental). You can quickly move a node to its
parent's parent or after a sibling, if they exist.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.597">This plugin allows you to associate information with nodes. This information is
organized around "labels", which is are just strings and freely chosen by the
user. The plugin allows you to create such a label quickly for each marked node,
and to mark all nodes which have a certain label. Labels can be converted to
subnodes, and vice versa. This facility allows you to add additional information
for each label. You can create clones for each node which has a label. These
clones are created as children of the current node. This last facility can be
used to create clones for each node which has been found or changed by the
standard search/replace dialog:

- Delete all marks.
- Do a "find all" / "change all".
- Convert the marks to a label.
- Run the "Clone label subnodes" command.

Finally, if you read a derived file, and the content of a node changes, the
previous content is available under the label "before change:"</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.647">A plugin to create and update ``@read-only`` nodes. I wanted to have the ability to
import files in "read-only" mode, that is, in a mode where files could only be
read by leo (not tangled), and also kept in sync with the content on the drive.
The reason for this is for example that I have external programs that generate
resource files. I want these files to be part of a leo outline, but I don't want
leo to tangle or in any way modify them. At the same time, I want them to be
up-to-date in the leo outline. This plugin has the following characteristics:

- It reads the specified file and puts it into the node content.

- If the ``@read-only`` directive was in the leo outline already, and the file content
  on disk has changed from what is stored in the outline, it marks the node as
  changed and prints a "changed" message to the log window; if, on the other hand,
  the file content has *not* changed, the file is simply read and the node is
  not marked as changed.

- When you write a ``@read-only`` directive, the file content is added to the node
  immediately, i.e. as soon as you press Enter (no need to call a menu
  entry to import the content).

- If you want to refresh/update the content of the file, just edit the headline
  and press Enter. The file is reloaded, and if in the meantime it has changed,
  a "change" message is sent to the log window.

- The body text of a ``@read-only`` file cannot be modified in leo.

The syntax to access files in ``@read-only`` via ftp/http is the following::

    @read-only http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt
    @read-only ftp://ftp.someserver.org/filepath

If FTP authentication (username/password) is required, it can be specified as follows::

    @read-only ftp://username:password@ftp.someserver.org/filepath</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.674">Runs a program and interface Leo through its input/output/error streams.
Double clicking the icon box whose headlines are ``@run 'cmd args'`` will execute
the command. There are several other features, including ``@arg`` and ``@input`` nodes.

The run_nodes.py plugin introduce two new nodes that transform leo into a
terminal. It was mostly intended to run compilers and debuggers while having the
possibility to send messages to the program.

- Double clicking on the icon of an node whose headline is::

    @run &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;

will launch &lt;command&gt; with the given arguments. It will also mark the node. #
Terminates the argument list. ``@run # &lt;comment&gt;`` is also valid.

- ``@in`` nodes are used to send input to the running process. Double clicking
  on the icon of an ``@in &lt;message&gt;`` node will append a "\n" to &lt;message&gt; and
  write it to the program, no matter where the node is placed. If no ``@run`` node is
  active, nothing happens.

- The body text of every child, in which the headlines do not begin with ``@run``
  or ``@in``, will be appended to &lt;command&gt;, allowing you to add an infinite number
  of arguments to &lt;command&gt;.

- The output of the program is written in the log pane (Error outputted in red).
  When the program exit the node is set unmarked and the return value is
  displayed...When the enter key is pressed in the body pane of an active ``@run``
  node the content of it body pane is written to the program and then emptied
  ready for another line of input. If the node have ``@run`` nodes in its descendants,
  they will be launched successively (unless one returned an exit code other
  than 0, then it will stop there).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.694">Launches (starts) a file given by a headline when double-clicking the icon.
Ignores headlines starting with an '@'. Uses the ``@folder`` path if the headline
is under an ``@folder`` headline. Otherwise the path is relative to the Leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.699">The AutoTrees plugin is a helper plugin designed to make it very easy to write
"handler" plugins to manage dynamic content in Leo outlines. AutoTrees provides:

- Convenient handler base classes which can be specialized for particular uses.
- A manager to turn handlers on and off.
- A set of example handlers to show the kinds of things that are possible.

AutoTrees doesn't do anything that you cannot do in other ways, but it does
provide a consistent way of adding dynamic content. This means that individual
plugin writers don't have to rewrite all the same kinds of code each time and
also makes it easier to maintain Leo, since it standardizes the way that certain
classes of plugin interact with the Leo core. Why use this? I'm a plugin writer
and I want to write a plugin to display dynamic content, i.e., content not
directly contained in the .leo or derived files, e.g.,

- email messages 
- news feeds
- news groups
- documentation
- remote files
- statistics
- file system data
- data base records

You can do this as a standard plugin, but as an AutoTrees handler you,

- don't need to write code that interacts with the tree (this is done for you)
- get centralized management
- can still do everything else you could as a normal plugin
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.868"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.869">Rebinds up/down arrow keys.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.874">Handles images in body text. Based on work by Gil Shwartz. Brent Burley provided
many important insights. See:
http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52264</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.880">Create a context menu when right-clicking in the body pane.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.904">Autocompletion and calltips plugin.

- ``.`` summons the autocompletion.
- ``(`` summons the calltips
- ``Escape`` closes either box.
- ``Ctrl`` selects an item.
- ``alt-up_arrow``, ``alt-down_arrow`` move up or down in the list.
  The mouse will work for this as well.

This plugin scans the complete outline at startup.
You many enable or disable features in autocompleter.ini.
This file contains two options under the [ autocompleter ] section::

    useauto
    usecalltips

Setting either to 1 will turn on the feature. 0 means off. If there is a section
called [ newlanguages ] it will read each option as a new language for
autocompleter to recognize, and compile its value as a regex pattern for the
autocompleter system to recognize as a calltip. This has relevance for the .ato
system described below.  Languages that currently have patterns::

    python, java, c++, c, perl

Autocompleter looks in the plugin directory for a directory called
autocompleter. If it doesn't find one it will attempt to create this directory.
This directory should contain what are called .ato files ( pronounced auto ).
Autocompleter will scan each .ato file that has a first part that matches a
languages name. For example: python.ato autocompleter recognizes python, and
will scan this file. The contents are read with the same mechanism that reads
the information in the nodes, so calltip and autocompleter information is added
to autocompleter's runtime database. If a new language has been added in the
autocompleter.ini file then an .ato file that starts with the new languages name

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.942">Handle coloring for markup in doc parts and Python triple-double-quoted strings.

**Important**:

- This plugin requires that the ``add_directives`` plugin is enabled.

- To color a text with wiki markup the text must be in the range of an ``@markup wiki`` directive.

The currently supported markups are::

    ''text''                    # write text in italics
    __text__                    # write text in bold
    ~~&lt;color&gt;:text~~            # write text in the color specified by &lt;color&gt; (e.g. blue, grey, etc)
    {picture file=&lt;filename&gt;}   # load the picture indicated by &lt;filename&gt;
    http://url                  # URL support: double clicking on the url will open it in the default browser.
    https://url                 # URL support: double clicking on the url will open it in the default browser.
    
-   Note 1: italics and bold markups can be nested, e.g.,::

        ''__text__''            # write text in italics and bold

    Just remember to terminate the tags in the order they were opened.

- Note 2: URLs must be terminated by a space.

By default, once the text has been markup up, the actual tags (e.g. ``__`` for
bold) are not displayed anymore. You can choose to display them selecting "Show
Invisibles" from the Edit menu.</t>

searches right from the main Leo window. All the current search options are
retained except that "search body text" is explicitly set - mainly because this
is by far the most common use case. Pressing &lt;CR&gt; while editing the text
automatically does a search. Repeated searches can be done by clicking the "GO"
button. The combo box also stores a list of previous searches, which can be
selected to quickly repeat a search. When activating a previous search the
original search mode is used.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.1092">This plugin supports Uniform Node Locators (UNL's). UNL's specify nodes within
Leo files. UNL's are not limited to nodes within the present Leo file; you can
use them to create cross-Leo-file links. This plugin consists of two parts:

1) Selecting a node shows the UNL in the status line at the bottom of the Leo
   window. You can copy from the status line and paste it into headlines, emails,
   whatever. 

2) Double-clicking ``@url`` nodes containing UNL's select the node specified in the
   UNL. If the UNL species in another Leo file, the other file will be opened.

UNL's referring to nodes within the present outline have the form::

    headline1--&gt;headline2--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

where headline1 is the headline of a top-level node, and each successive headline is
the headline of a child node.  UNL's of the form::

    file:&lt;path&gt;#headline1--&gt;...--&gt;headlineN

refer to a node specified in &lt;path&gt; For example, double clicking the following
headline will take you to Chapter 8 of Leo's Users Guide::

    @url file:c:/prog/leoCvs/leo/doc/leoDocs.leo#Users Guide--&gt;Chapter 8: Customizing Leo
    
For example, suppose you want to email someone with comments about a Leo file.
Create a comments.leo file containing ``@url UNL`` nodes. That is, headlines are
``@url`` followed by a UNL. The body text contains your comments about the nodes in
the _other_ Leo file! Send the comments.leo to your friend, who can use the
comments.leo file to quickly navigate to the various nodes you are talking
about. As another example, you can copy UNL's into emails. The recipient can
navigate to the nodes 'by hand' by following the arrows in the UNL.

**Notes**:

- At present, UNL's refer to nodes by their position in the outline. Moving a
  node will break the link.

- Don't refer to nodes that contain UNL's in the headline. Instead, refer to the
  parent or child of such nodes.

- You don't have to replace spaces in URL's or UNL's by '%20'.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.2726">This plugin creates menu items in the File:Open With menu.

@openwith nodes in @settings trees create menu items. The openWith
plugin must be active for these settings to have any effect.

The headline of an @openwith node has the form::

    @openwith name = shortcut
    
name is name of the menu item. shortcut specifies the shortcut used to invoke
the menu item. shortcut may be None.

The body text @openwith nodes should contain a single line contain a tuple of the form::

    command,arg,ext

For example::
    
    'subprocess.Popen',['pythonw','C:/Python24/Lib/idlelib/idle.pyw'],'.py'
    
When the user selects this menu itmen Leo executes command(arg+path) where path
is the full path to the temp file. The ext argument specifies the extension of
the temp file.
    
Notes:

- command is a string.  Valid values are::
    
  'subprocess.Popen'
  'os.system'
  'os.startfile'
  'os.spawnl'
  'os.spawnv'
  'exec'
  
- arg is either a single string or a list of strings.

- ext is a string or None. If None, Leo computes a file extension base on what
  @language directive is in effect.
  
- If the .leo file being loaded contains  @openwith nodes, the File:Open With menu contains only the items created by those nodes.  Similarly, @openwith nodes in myLeoSettings.leo override entries in leoSettings.leo.

- If no @openwith nodes are found anywhere the openWith plugin uses hard-coded tables in the plugin itself.

This plugin will use Python's new subprocess module if it is present. This
module comes standard with Python 2.4. For Linux systems, Leo will use
subprocess.py in Leo's extensions folder if necessary.

For Windows systems you can install Python's subprocess module in Python 2.2 or
2.3 as follows:
    
- Go to http://www.effbot.org/downloads/#subprocess

- Download and execute one of the following installers, depending on your version of Python::

    subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.3.exe 
    subprocess-0.1-20041012.win32-py2.2.exe

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.2768">Multipath enables the ability to write a file to multiple locations. It acts as
a post-write mechanism, a file must be written to the file system for it to work.
At this point it is not a replacement for ``@path`` or an absolute path, it works in
tandem with them. To use, place ``@multipath`` at the start of a line in the root
node or an ancestor of the node. The format is (On Unix systems)::
    
    @multipath /machine/unit/:/machine/robot/:/machine/
    
It will place a copy of the written file in each of these directories.

There is an additional directive that simplifies common paths, it is called
``@multiprefix``. By typing ``@multiprefix`` with a path following it, before a
``@multipath`` directive you set the beginning of the paths in the
``@multipath`` directive. For example::

    @multiprefix /leo #@multipath /plugins 

or::

    @multiprefix /leo/
    @multipath plugins: fungus : drain

copies a file to /leo/plugins /leo/fungus /leo/drain.

The ``@multiprefix`` stays in effect for the entire tree until reset with
another ``@multiprefix`` directive. ``@multipath`` is cumulative, in that for
each ``@multipath`` in an ancestor a copy of the file is created. These
directives must at the beginning of the line and by themselves.</t>

requires an INI file then a configure menu item will be created which will show
an INI file editor. The plugin can define an ``applyConfiguration`` function,
which will be called when the configuration changes. Plugins can also define a
top level function to be called instead of the default "About" dialog by
defining a "topLevelMenu" function in the plugin. This function will be called
when the user clicks on the plugin name in the plugins menu, but only if the
plugin was loaded properly and registered with ``g.plugin_signon``.

Plugins can define their name by setting the ``__plugin_name__`` property.
Plugins can also attempt to select the order they will appear in the menu by
defining a ``__plugin_prioriy__``. The menu will be created with the highest
priority items first. This behaviour is not guaranteed since other plugins can
define any priority. This priority does not affect the order of calling

<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.3057">A plugin to create script buttons and ``@button``, ``@plugin`` and ``@script`` nodes.
This plugin puts two buttons in the icon area: a button called ``run Script`` and
a button called ``script Button``. The ``run Script`` button is simply another way
of doing the Execute Script command: it executes the selected text of the
presently selected node, or the entire text if no text is selected. The 'script
Button' button creates another button in the icon area every time you push it.
The name of the button is the headline of the presently selected node. Hitting
this _new_ button executes the button's script.

For example, to run a script on any part of an outline do the following:

1.  Select the node containing the script.
2.  Press the scriptButton button.  This will create a new button, call it X.
3.  Select the node on which you want to run the script.
4.  Push button X.

That's all.  You can delete a script button by right-clicking on it.
This plugin optionally scans for ``@button`` nodes, ``@plugin`` nodes and ``@script`` nodes
whenever a .leo file is opened.

- ``@button`` nodes create script buttons.
- ``@plugin`` nodes cause plugins to be loaded.
- ``@script`` nodes cause a script to be executed when opening a .leo file.

Such nodes may be security risks. This plugin scans for such nodes only if the
corresponding atButtonNodes, atPluginNodes, and atScriptNodes constants are set
to True in this plugin.</t>

plugin module for the Leo outlining editor.
For more information see:  http://www.marshallresearch.com/michael-dawson/os/leo.html
I am still using Leo version 4.1 (rc3, build 1.62), as I've been unable to keep
up with the speed of Edward's Leo development. He has made such significant
changes to Leo since 4.1 that I doubt that Leo2AsciiDoc will work with any
version later than 4.1. I do intend to rewrite Leo2AsciiDoc for the new Leo, but
there is no schedule set. 

Leo2AscDoc enables the contents of plain text Leo outlines to be published to HTML
or PDF via the AsciiDoc program and the DocBook set of publishing tools. Plain
text from the Leo outline can be transformed into a final result that has
typeset body text, in which bulleted and numbered lists, variable lists, page
numbers, URLs, index terms,and bold and italic text are automatically
recognized. typeset Headings a Table of Contents an Index containing any items
marked by the user, and any Python classes or functions. To produce HTML and
PDF, you'll need to have the AsciiDoc program installed (a trivial task) and a
DocBook tool chain installed, which is not a trivial task. And, of course,
Python and Leo. In sum, this little program is an easy install for people who
are already using Leo and DocBook. As noted later, Leo2AsciiDoc has only been
tested on Linux</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050912125735.3832">The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing rST
(reStructuredText_) markup. rst3 options control most aspects of this plugin's
operations. You can set options in ``@settings`` trees, in headlines and in body
text. There are too many options to describe here. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation. To
use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils_ module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity_ syntax coloring package if it installed.

The rst3 plugin adds the ``Write Restructured Text`` command to Leo's Edit menu.
This command searches the selected outline looking for **rst root nodes** whose
headline have the form::

    @rst &lt;filename&gt;

The plugin then creates the named file in various ways depending which rst3
options are in effect. By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings
automatically from outlines, so the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond
to higher-level sections in the output. Creating rST headings automatically
eliminates one of the most tedious chores associated with rST markup.
This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.

For full details on this plugin, see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html

**New in Leo 4.4.1**:
A new method has been added to the rst3 plugin to make it more easily to drive
the plugin from scripts::

    def writeNodeToString (self,p=None,ext=None)

writeNodeToString scans p's tree (p defaults to presently selected node) looking for @rst nodes.
When the first @rst node is found, writeNodeToString processes the node as usual, with the following changes:

- @rst need not be followed by a filename; any filename and its extension are *ignored*.

- Only the ``ext`` argument to writeNodeToString determines the type of output produced.
  The valid values for the ``ext`` argument are None (for rst output), '.html', '.pdf', and '.tex'.

- Instead of writing the result to a file, writeNodeToString returns the tuple (p,s),
  where p is the node whose tree produced the output, and s is the output itself.

- writeNodeToString returns after processing at most one @rst node.

Scripts can easily use writeNodeToString to convert @rst trees into various kinds of output.
For example, here is the body of @button rst-&gt;html in LeoDocs.leo::

    import leoPlugins
    rst3 = leoPlugins.getPluginModule('rst3')
    if rst3:
        controller = rst3.controllers.get(c)
        if controller:
            p,s = controller.writeNodeToString(ext='.html')
            print '*' * 40,p
            print s

Notes:

- This script scans the presently selected tree for @rst nodes, just like the @button rst script does.
  In particular, if the presently selected tree does not contain an @rst node the search continues in parent trees.
  When an @rst node is found, it converts the node (and descendants) to html and returns p,
  the found @rst node and s, the html itself.

- The script shown above merely prints the output, but many other actions could be taken.
  In particular, because writeNodeToString returns p it would be possible to write a script that
  would scan multiple @rst nodes.

- None and '.tex' are also valid values for the ext argument to writeNodeToString.
  None converts the @rst tree to a single reStructuredText string, as shown in @button rst-&gt;rst.

- There is some support for ext='.pdf', but this is experimental code.  Expect crashes.</t>

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of 4.3.2:
-----------------------

- Improved Leo's documentation:
    - A tutorial introduction to Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html
    - A 5-minute guide to programming with Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#quick-start-for-programmers

- The new rst3 plugin creates .html and .tex files from reStructuredText
  embedded in Leo files. Any node of the source outline may contain options for
  the rst3 plugin, which makes this plugin much more useful and flexible than
  the previous rst plugins. All of Leo's documentation was created using this
  plugin from sources in LeoDocs.leo. For full documentation for rst3 see:
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html.

- The spellpyx (spell checking) plugin is now much easier to use.

- The vim and openWith plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present.
 
- Improved the Pretty Printing command.

Here would be a nice place to insert 2 screen shots that illustrate the points
discussed: one of a very small @thin tree in Leo, and one of the contents of
the file that's derived from that node, as seen in vim or jEdit or notepad.

Also the paragraph on clones might benefit from a screen shot or two, especially
since the tutorial contains a lot of text and ideas to grasp. Pictures in between
give the opportunity to ponder on the meaning of all that for a while while
staring at them...</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158">This is the rST version of the Tech Report handed out at EuroPython in 2005.

**Important**: Leo's tutorial is now a clearer explanation of the basics.
This tech report should be rewritten.

The Essentials of Leo
##########################################

.. contents::</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.2">Leo organizes all data into nodes containing a **headline**, an expandable page of
**body text** and a (possibly empty) subtree of **descendant nodes**. The **contents** of a
node are its headline and body text. Leo’s main window contains an **outline** pane
at the top left, a **log pane** at the top right, and a **body pane** at the bottom. The
outline pane shows headlines; the body pane shows the body text of the selected
headline. The log pane displays messages from Leo.

Small red arrows mark **cloned nodes** (clones). Clones share the same content and
descendants. All clones of the same node are equivalent, so changing the
contents of one node (call it node N) changes the contents of all clones of N.
Furthermore, inserting, deleting or changing any descendant of node N causes the
corresponding insertion, deletion or change in all other clones of N.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.3">Clones allow you to organize data in multiple ways within the same outline. You
do not have to choose a single ‘correct’ organization: you can organize your
data in as many ways as you like.

You can use **organizer nodes** to create explicit relations (relationships) among
the data in your outline. The headline of the organizer node is the
relationship’s name. Now make clones of nodes from other parts of the outline
that participate in the relation. Drag the newly created clones so they become
children of the organizer node. You may want to create other (non-cloned)
children of the organizer node that contain data found nowhere else in the
outline. Voilà: you have just created the set of all nodes that pertain to the
relationship. The organizer node is the relation; the terms relation,
relationship and organizer node are interchangeable.

Three kinds of relations deserve special mention. A **view** is a relation (an
organizer node) containing all nodes related to a desired view (or slice) of the
data in the outline. Similarly, a **task** is an organizer node containing all nodes
related to a task. Relations are not limited to tasks or views: the notion of
relationship is completely general. Headlines naturally describe the data in
body text. That is, nodes relate **metadata** (descriptions of data) to data.
Separating data from metadata is useful for humans. It is even more valuable for
scripts: scripts can access data and metadata without complex parsing.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.4">Plugins are Python (.py) files contained in Leo’s plugins folder. Users can
write plugins to change how Leo works and to add new features without changing
Leo’s core code. We’ll discuss plugins in more detail later.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.5">Leo can generate many external files called **derived files** from an outline. Leo
outlines can organize files throughout your computer’s file system. Nodes whose
headlines start with ‘@’ are special nodes. Several **special nodes** indicate the
root of a tree that generates a derived file::

    @asis filename    Creates a derived file. Ignores all markup in body text.
    @file filename    Creates a derived file. Duplicates outline structure in .leo file.
    @noref filename   Creates a derived file. Ignores all section references.
    @nosent filename  Creates a derived file without sentinels.
    @thin filename    (Recommended) Like @file, but thin derived files contain all outline structure.

Leo recognizes several other special nodes::

    @settings   Defines settings local to the .leo file.
    @url url    Double-clicking the node’s icon opens the url in Leo or in a browser.

The scripting plugin scans for the following nodes when opening an outline::

    @button         Creates a button in the **icon area** at the top of the Leo window.
    @plugin plugin  Enables a plugin if the plugin has not already been enabled.
    @script         Executes a script when opening the outline. This is a security risk: it is disabled by default.

Plugins, @button nodes and @script nodes can create other kinds of special nodes::

    @suite       Creates a suite of unit tests from script in body. Requires scripting plugin.
    @test        Creates a unit text from script in body. Requires scripting plugin.
    @rst         Outputs a tree containing markup for reStructuredText. Requires rst2 plugin.
    @run command Double clicking the node’s icon executes the command.  Requires run_nodes plugin.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.6">Leo’s Execute Script command **preprocesses** the script to be executed by scanning
a node N and its descendants looking for markup. **Markup** is special syntax that
controls this preprocessing. If node N contains no markup, the resulting script
is just N’s body text. Otherwise, the preprocessed script will include text from
descendant nodes as described below. The main kinds of markup are **section
references**, **directives** and **doc parts**.

1.  **Section references** have the form::

        &lt;&lt;section name&gt;&gt;

    The ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` must appear on the same line. Conversely, any line
    containing ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` is a section reference, regardless of context. However,
    section references are not recognized in doc parts. Any characters may appear
    between ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;``.
    
    Section references are functional pseudo-code: while preprocessing a script, Leo
    replaces section references by the actual text of the section’s definition.
    Sections are defined in **section definition nodes**, whose headlines start with a
    section reference and whose body text defines the section. Each section
    definition node must descend from the node containing the section reference.

2.  **Directives** start with ‘@’ in the leftmost column of body text. Directives
    specify options and control Leo’s operation. The ``@others`` directive is the
    minimal markup needed to organize scripts. ``@others`` tells Leo to insert the
    preprocessed text of all descendant nodes (except section definition nodes) at
    the spot at which the ``@others`` directive occurs. Nodes are inserted in **outline
    order**, the order in which nodes appear in the outline. **Important**: Leo adds the
    whitespace preceding the ``@others`` directive to the indentation of all
    preprocessed text.
    
    Using ``@others`` is more convenient than using section references. Use ``@others`` when
    the order of included text does not matter::
    
        class myClass:
	        @others # Include the methods of the class. Order doesn’t matter.

    Use section references when the order of included text does matter. In the following script, for example,
    &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; ensures that imports come first. The ``@others`` directive then includes the body text of all other
    descendant nodes::
    
        @language python
        &lt;&lt; imports&gt;&gt;
        @others # Define classes &amp; functions in child nodes.
        main()

    Here is a list of all of Leo’s standard directives::
    
        @whitespace (or @doc)   Starts a doc part &amp; ends code part.
        @all                    Like @others, but includes all descendant nodes.
        @c, @code               Starts a code part and ends a doc part.
        @color                  Enables syntax coloring.
        @delims                 Temporarily changes comment delims.
        @nocolor, @killcolor    Disables syntax coloring.
        @comment                Sets comment delimiters in external (derived) files.
        @language languagename  Sets language for syntax coloring and comments.
        @lineending lineending  Sets ending of lines in derived files.
        @others                 Inserts body text of all descendants except definition nodes. 
        @pagewidth n            Sets page width for justifying comments in doc parts.
        @path path              Sets prefix to use in relative file names in @file nodes, etc.
        @root filename          Marks the root of a tree that creates an external file.
        @raw, @end_raw          Inhibits sections references in a range of text. (@file only.)
        @tabwidth n             Sets width of tabs (negative widths convert tabs to spaces.)
        @wrap, @nowrap          Controls wrapping of text in body pane.
    
3.  Doc parts start with the ‘@’ directive and continue until the end of the body text or until the ‘@c’ directive.
    Body text not in a doc part is in a code part. Here is an example of a doc part::

        @ This is a doc part. Doc parts may span many lines. Leo converts doc parts to comments.
        Leo reformats the doc part by justifying lines so they are no longer than the page width.
        @c

    Leo reformats doc parts by justifying the text into comment lines.
    The ``@pagewidth`` directive controls the length of these comment lines.
    The ``@language`` and ``@comment`` directives specify the comment delimiters used in doc parts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.7">The ``Execute Script`` command preprocesses the selected text of the presently
selected outline node, or the entire text of the node if there is no selected
text. See the section called ``Markup for Scripts`` for a discussion of how Leo
preprocesses scripts. That section also discusses how Leo organizes scripts
using outlines. Conversely, scripts can use outlines to organize their data. To
write such scripts you must understand at least the basics of Leo’s modules and
classes...
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.8">Leo’s source code is organized as a collection of modules. The following
paragraphs describe five of the most important modules. See ``LeoPy.leo`` (Leo’s
full source code) for more details: scripts have full access to all of Leo’s
classes and data.

1.  The **leoGlobals** module contains utility functions.
    By convention, in Leo’s code ``g`` is always the ``leoGlobals`` module.

2.  The **leoApp** module defines a class representing the entire Leo application.
    **g.app** is the singleton object of this class: the application object.
    The instance variables (ivars) of the application object are Leo’s global variables.
 
3.  The leoCommands module defines the Commands class.
    A commander is an instance of this class.
    Commanders contain the operations that can be performed on a particular outline.
    Each open Leo outline has its own commander.
    By convention, in Leo’s code **c** is always a commander.

4.  The leoFrame module defines the base leoFrame class for objects that create and manage
    the visual appearance of Leo’s windows and panes.
    The **leoTkinterFrame** and **leoTkinterTree** modules contain subclasses of the base classes in the leoFrame module.
    A frame (an instance of the leoFrame class, or a subclass)
    contains all the internal data needed to manage a Leo window.
    **c.frame** is the frame associated with commander c.
    If **f** is a frame, **f.c** is the frame’s commander, **f.body** is the frame’s body pane,
    **f.tree** is the frame’s outline pane, and **f.log** is the frame’s log pane.

5.  The leoNodes module defines several classes that implement Leo’s fundamental data structures.
    These classes are complex.
    Happily, scripts can and should ignore these complications by accessing nodes using
    high-level methods of the position class.

A **position** (an instance of the position class) is the state of some traversal of an outline. Equivalently, a position is a particular visual place in an outline. Cloned nodes may appear many times in an outline. Non-cloned nodes may also appear in many places: consider a non-cloned descendant of a cloned node. By convention, in Leo’s source code p is a position.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.9">When executing scripts Leo predefines the following three symbols:
**c** is the commander of the outline in which the script is defined,
**g** is the leoGlobals module and
**p** is the position of the selected node in c’s outline, i.e., ``c.currentPosition()``.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.10">Scripts should get and set data using high-level access methods. Here are some important getters::

    g.app                The application object. Its ivars are Leo’s global variables.
    g.app.windowList     The list of all open frames.
    c.currentPosition()  The position of the selected node.
    c.rootPosition()     The position of the first node in the outline.
    p.headString()       The headline of position p.
    p.bodyString()       The body text of position p.
    p.childIndex()       The number of siblings that precede p.
    p.numberOfChildren() The number of p’s children.
    p.level()            The number of p’s ancestors.
    p.hasChildren()      True if p has children.
    p.isAncestorOf(p2)   True if p2 is a child, grandchild, etc. of p.
    p.isCloned()         True if p is a clone.
    p.isDirty()          True if p’s contents have been changed.
    p.isExpanded()       True if p has children and p’s outline is expanded.
    p.isMarked()         True if p’s headline is marked.
    p.isVisible()        True if all of p’s ancestors are expanded.

And here are some important setters::

    c.setBodyString(p,s) Set body text of p to s.
    c.setHeadString(p,s) Set headline of p to s.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.11">Scripts can visit some or all of the nodes of a Leo outline using the following iterators::

    c.allNodes_iter             # All positions in the outline, in outline order.
    p.children_iter()           # All children of p.
    p.parents_iter()            # All parents of p.
    p.siblings_iter()           # All siblings of p, including p.
    p.following_siblings_iter() # All siblings following p, not including p.

For example, the following prints all the nodes of an outline, properly indented::

    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        print ' '*p.level(), p.headString()</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.12">Scripts may open other Leo outlines, or execute any of Leo’s commands.  Here are some examples::

    ok,frame = g.openWithFileName(path,c)	# Opens the .leo file found at path.
    c.deleteOutline()   # Deletes the selected node.
    c.insertHeadline()  # Inserts a new node after present position.

For more examples, see ``Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python``, in ``Leo’s Users Guide``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.13">The scripting plugin creates two buttons in the icon area at the top of the Leo
window. The ``Run Script`` button executes the script in the selected node just
like the ``Execute Script`` command. The ``Script Button`` button creates a new
button whose headline is the headline of the presently selected node, call it
node N. Pressing this button executes the script in node N with p predefined as
``c.currentPosition()`` at the time the script is executed. This clever trick
brings the script to the data in the selected outline.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.14">``test.leo`` contains all of Leo’s unit tests. An ``@button node`` in test.leo
creates a blue ``Unit Test`` button in the icon area. This button is an
excellent example of bringing scripts to data. The ``Unit Test`` button executes
all the unit tests specified by ``@test`` and ``@suite`` nodes in the selected
outline. **Important**: ``@button``, ``@test`` and ``@suite`` nodes require the
scripting plugin to be enabled.

``@test`` nodes greatly simplify unit testing. The ``Unit Test`` button creates
a unit test from the body text of each ``@test`` node. In effect, the ``Unit
Test`` button automatically creates an instance of ``unittest.TestCase`` whose
run method is the body text of the @test node. There is no need to create
``TestCase`` objects explicitly!

``@suite`` nodes support legacy unit tests. When the ``Unit Test`` script button
finds an ``@suite node`` it executes the script in its body text. This script
should create a suite of unit tests and set::

    g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite

where suite is the created suite. The ``Unit Test`` button then runs that
created suite of unit tests.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050916184158.15">Plugins are Python (.py) files in Leo’s plugin subdirectory. It is easy to
create new plugins: Leo’s users have contributed dozens of plugins that extend
Leo’s capabilities in new ways. Leo imports all enabled plugins during startup.
The file pluginsManager.txt lists all enabled plugins. You can use the plugin
manager plugin to control plugins without updating ``pluginsManager.txt`` by hand.

Plugins can override any class, method or function in Leo’s core, the files in
Leo’s src subdirectory (the files derived from LeoPy.leo). Besides altering
Leo’s core, plugins can register functions called hooks that Leo calls at
various times during Leo’s execution. Events that trigger hooks include key
pressed events, screen drawing events, node selection events and many others.
When importing a plugin, Leo will call the top-level init() function if it
exists. This function should register the plugin’s hooks by calling
leoPlugins.registerHandler.

For full details about hooks and events see ``Chapter 13: Writing Plugins``, in
``Leo’s Users Guide``. The file ``leoPlugins.leo`` contains all plugins that are
presently distributed with Leo; studying these plugins is a good way of learning
to write your own plugins.</t>

Leo 4.3.3 fixes several bugs reported in Leo 4.3.2 final in the last several days.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of 4.3.3 (and 4.3.2)
-----------------------------------

- Improved Leo's documentation:
    - A tutorial introduction to Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html
    - A 5-minute guide to programming with Leo:
      http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#quick-start-for-programmers

- The new rst3 plugin creates .html and .tex files from reStructuredText
  embedded in Leo files. Any node of the source outline may contain options for
  the rst3 plugin, which makes this plugin much more useful and flexible than
  the previous rst plugins. All of Leo's documentation was created using this
  plugin from sources in LeoDocs.leo. For full documentation for rst3 see:
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html.

- The spellpyx (spell checking) plugin is now much easier to use.

- The vim and openWith plugins now use Python's subprocess module if it is present.
 
- Improved the Pretty Printing command.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.1">Here is a summary of the changes:

- General:  All chapters created with rst3 plugin.  This ensures a uniform look.  The source is in LeoDocs.leo.  Removed all references to older versions of Leo, except when discussing old file formats in the Appendices.  Corrected all text so it discusses present version.

- rst3 plugin itself:  Correct bug that caused chapters to be formatted differently when processing multiple @rst trees.  

- rst3 button in LeoDocs.leo:  The script first looks *up* the tree, looking for an @rst node.  If found, it processes just that tree.  If not found, it processes all @rst nodes *below* the originally selected node.  The button is now much more convenient to use.

- Preface: Shorter, no history.  No longer a dead end.

- What People are Saying About Leo: No longer a dead end.

- FAQ: Reorganized, simplified, revised.  Added entries for running Leo in a console window and debugging docutils.  Improved entry for using cvs.

- Chapter 1: Installation: Now the first chapter.  Revised.

- Chapter 2: Tutorial: Completely rewritten.  Like Python's tutorial, this chapter contains everything a beginner needs to understand and use Leo.  The `Quickstart for programmers` section is the heart of this chapter.  All terms used have links either to their definition in the tutorial or in the Glossary.  Newbies should be able to digest this chapter easily.  This chapter should make Leo comprehensible to many more people.

- Chapter 3: Using Outlines: Revised per general remarks above.

- Chapter 4: Writing Programs in Leo.  Completely rewritten.  The old chapter was an embarrassment. The new chapter is a reference guide, properly organized as such.  The introduction warns newbies away.

- Chapter 5: Using Leo's Commands.  'Minor' revisions and corrections create a substantially better result.

- Chapter 6: Leo and literate programming: Reformatting helps.  New words about rST markup and other improvements over traditional LP.

- Chapter 7: Scripting Leo with Python: Rewritten, simplified, updated and corrected.  The sources in LeoDocs.leo are directly executable.  rST sources use literal blocks instead of code-blocks so that the sources are simplified. (Important when executing examples).  Properly discusses positions, including 'supremely important' section on copying positions.

- Chapter 8: Customizing Leo.  Heavily revised.  Discusses leoSettings.leo, not leoConfig.txt.  Security warnings are more reasonable.  Section on script buttons. Rewrote section on uA's (Adding extensible attributes to nodes and .leo files).

- Chapter 9: History of Leo.  Rewritten.  Much shorter and more useful.  Discusses the major milestones, concentrating on explaining the major differences between versions.  Gone are details of how discoveries came to be.  They are in LeoPostings.leo, which will be included in the distribution.

- Chapter 10: Theory of Operation.  Largely rewritten.  Discusses positions properly.  Omits discussion of how clones were implemented before 4.2.

- Chapter 11: White Papers.  A new chapter.  This is a slightly-edited version of writing that had been buried in the appendices.

- Appendices.  Heavily revised and reformatted.  Rewrote sections on file formats.

- Glossary: A separate chapter.  All terms have links to their definition.  All definitions are rST targets so other chapters may refer to them.  Added several new entries.

test.leo had some non-@ignore'd @thin nodes for files not in the distribution.

- Only files used by unit tests should be on cvs and the distribution.
    - test\unittest\batchTest.py and test\unittest\errorTest.py were already on cvs.
    - Added these files to the distribution.

- Other test files should be distributed in @ignore nodes.

- Leo's distribution checklist now has an item to check that the distributed test.leo can be opened without errors.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.8"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.9">See http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/rstplugin3.html for full documentation
of this plugin.

The rst3 plugin creates output files from Leo outlines containing
reStructuredText (rST) ReStructuredText is a simple and powerful text formatting
markup language. Outlines are a natural way to organize rST (or any text).

This plugin adds the Write Restructured Text command to Leo's Edit menu. The
Write Restructured Text command searches the selected outline looking for rst
root nodes whose headline have the form @rst &lt;filename&gt;. The plugin then creates
the named file in various ways depending which rst3 options are in effect.

By default, the rst3 plugin creates rST headings automatically from outlines, so
the higher-level nodes in the outline correspond to higher-level sections in the
output. Creating rST headings automatically relieves you from one of the most
tedious chores in creating rST markup.

To use this plugin effectively, Python's docutils module must be installed. The
rst3 plugin will use the SilverCity syntax coloring package if it installed.

This plugin sends .htm, .html or .tex files to the docutils module for further
processing. Docutils generates HTML files or LaTeX files depending on the file's
extension. HTML files generated by docutils refer to three .css (cascading style
sheet) files that should exist in the same directory as the generated HTML file.
You can control the formatting of the HTML file by altering these .css files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20050917092557.10">This plugin now allows quotes within words, but strips quotes and other cruft
from the beginning and end of words. As a result, using the spellpyx spell
checker is much easier than before.

Leo's extensions folder now contains aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd. These are
Python dll's compiled for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. You must rename one

Leo 4.4 a4 introduces the 'Newer World Order' for redrawing the screen,
corrects numerous bugs in the 4.4 code base, and introduces several new features.

You should be able to use this version safely. There are no known serious bugs,
but several minibuffer commands are not ready for primve time. All the major
features of 4.4 are in place.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
----------------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name. Support for tab completion.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Support for almost all commands in the Emacs Cmds menu, including cursor
and screen movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and
commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles.

- Per-pane key bindings. You can bind shortcuts to multiple commands depending
on which of Leo's panes presently has focus. For example, you can use arrow keys
to move nodes in the outline pane, while retaining their defaults in Leo's body
pane. Per-pane key bindings are essential for mouseless Leo.

- @command nodes create minibuffer commands. You can bind key shortcuts to
@button and @command nodes.

- A rewrite of Leo's keystroke handling. In particular, Leo handles key events
immediately rather than queuing them for idle time.

- Leo recovers from crashes much more reliably than in any prevsios version.

- Leo updates the screen immediately rather than waiting for idle time.
This 'Newer World Order' simplifies the code and improves performance.

Known bugs in Leo 4.4a4
-----------------------
- Several minibuffer commands do not work.  See the release notes for details.

Coming in later releases of Leo 4.4:
------------------------------------
- An auto-complete command that shows class members in the Completion tab.

- More support for mouseless Leo. There will be commands to manipulate all
aspects of Leo using commands, so your fingers will never have to leave the
keyboard.

- Support for Vim and other 'plain-key' input modes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.1">Here are the default bindings relating to the minibuffer. Any of
these may be changed by changing @shortcuts nodes in leoSettings.leo.

Alt-x: Just like Emacs: starts minibuffer. The prompt is 'full-command' Type a
full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion
works, but not for file names.

Alt-c: Like Emacs Control-C: (Ctrl-C conflicts with XP cut). starts minibuffer.
The prompt is 'quick-command'. This mode is not completed, but stuff like
`Ctrl-C r` and `Ctrl r r` do work.

Alt-u: Like Emacs Ctrl-u: (Ctrl-u conflicts with move-outline-up). Add a repeat
count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's, but many features remain
unfinished.

Ctrl-g: Just like Emacs Ctrl-g: Closes the mini-buffer.

The @bool useMinibuffer setting in leoSettings.leo just controls whether the
minibuffer is visible. The minibuffer exists (and you can type into it) even if
it isn't visible! You can use the show-mini-buffer, hide-mini-buffer and
toggle-mini-buffer commands to show or hide the minibuffer.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.2">The most important new features of Leo 4.4 have to do with key bindings.

See the children of this node for details.


</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.4"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.5">1. The minibuffer exists regardless of this setting, but will not be shown
   initially if it is False.

2. Hiding the minibuffer does not change any bindings or the operation of Leo in
   any other way. Therefore, if you do hide the minibuffer initially, and never
   want to use it, you should not bind shortcuts to any commands that use the
   minibuffer.

3. You can execute the show-mini-buffer, hide-mini-buffer and toggle-mini-buffer
   commands (or any other minibuffer command!) if the minibuffer is hidden.
   Indeed, the following will work even if the minibuffer is hidden.

       &lt;alt-x&gt;show-mini-buffer&lt;return&gt;</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.6">This options controls whether Leo creates a Cmds menu.

This menu is not ready yet, though nothing bad happens if this option is True.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.7">http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3355954

'body_text_selection_background_color'  Default is 'Gray80'
'body_text_selection_foreground_color'  Default is 'white'</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.8">- The contract-and-go-right command moves to the parent node and collapses the
parent node.

- The goto-first-sibling and goto-last-sibling commands allow rapid movement
through an ouline without collapsing nodes.

- The print-bindings and print-commands show what commands exist and what keys
are bound to them.

- The help command gives a brief quick start introduction to Leo's Emacs-like
features.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.9"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.10">Leo maintains the following dictionaries.  As usual, k refers to c.keyHandler:

- c.keyHandler.registerCommand can be called from scripts to register new alt-x
  commands. It probably won't work from plugins yet.

New dictionaries and methods make it easier to customize and extend Leo:

- c.commandsDict describes all commands. Keys are full Emacs command names;
values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict: keys are f.__name__, values are emacs command names.

- k.leoCallbackDict: keys are leoCallback functions, values are called
functions.

- k.bindingsDict: keys are shortcuts, values are g.bunches with the following
    members: func, name, warningGiven, fromMenu.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.11">The following helper functions make it easy to discover the binding presently in
effect for a command:

- k.getShortcutForCommandName(self,commandName) returns the shortcut given
  f.__name__.

- k.getShortcutForCommand(self,f) returns the shortcut for f.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.12">@nocolor

c.keyHandlerregisterCommand (self,commandName,shortcut,func)

This function make the func available as a minibuffer command, and optionally
binds a shortcut to func. You can wrap any method in a function, so the
restriction to functions is not significant.

Here is an example take from an @button node::

@color

k = c.keyHandler

def f (event):
    g.es_print('Hello',color='purple')

k.registerCommand('print-hello','Alt-Ctrl-Shift-p',f)
k.registerCommand('print-hello2',None,f)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.13">The following bugs exist in 4.3 final.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.14">This makes it much harder to hang Leo after taking an exception. Leo 4.4a1 is
*much* more robust than Leo 4.3 final in this regard.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051444.15">Added big kludge to menu.createMenuEntries so that f.OnCut/Copy/PasteFromMenu get called
**only** when explicitly selected from the menu (rather than from a shortcut).
This allows the code in cut/copy/paste-text to be different as needed.

Users can override the shortcut by assigning shortcuts to cut/copy/paste-text commands.
The shortcut will appear in the menu, but does **not** get bound to c.frame.menu.

This is an essential step in solving the infamous Control-V problem.
The code appears to work properly on XP.  Not tested other places.

This is the last best hope to solve this problem: the code interacts as little as possible with Tk.</t>

The scripting plugin has been improved as follows:

1. You can bind shortcuts in @button nodes.  Like this:

@button name @key=shortcut

This binds the shortcut to the script in the script button.  The button's name is 'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the mouse over the button.  This is a clean and simple way of discovering the shortcut.

2. You can create your own minibuffer commands with @command nodes.

A node whose headline has the form:

@command command-name

a new minibuffer command whose name is 'command-name'.

A node whose headline has the form:

@command command-name @key=shortcut

creates new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it.

3.  The scripting plugin no longer contains the 'bindLate' code-level option.  The scripts for all @button or @command nodes are computed 'dynamically', that is, when the button is pushed or the command is executed from the minibuffer.  This is the most useful way, and the most intuitive.

Previously, scripts for @button nodes were never dynamic, while scripts in @button nodes created by the 'Script button' button were dynamic only if bindLate was True.  You could call this a bug: it was unhelpful, annoying and confusing.

4. The scripting plugin no longer prints an 'end of script' message.  This allows scripts to select tabs in the log pane</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051616.172">@color

# Plugins and scripts can easily create new tabs in the log panel.
# Important: you can run any of these examples using the 'Run Script' button.

# To create a tab named "Test" or make it visible if it already exists:
 
c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')

# When first created, a tab contains a text widget.
# To write to this widget, add the tabName argument to g.es:

g.es('Test',color='blue',tabName='Test')

# Plugins and scripts can easily replace the default Text widget with other Tk widgets.
# c.frame.log.tabFrame contains the Tk.Frame that contains all the other widgets of the frame.
# c.frame.log.logCtrl contains the Tk.Text widget that is initially the only widget in this frame.
# So to remove this text widget just do:
    
c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack_forget()

# Now you can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.

import Tkinter as Tk ; log = c.frame.log
log.selectTab('Test')
log.logCtrl.pack_forget()
f = Tk.Frame(log.tabFrame,bg='red',height='1inch',width='2inch')
f.pack(side='left',expand=0,fill='none')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028051616.299">Leo can optionally generate matching brackets depending on the setting:

@bool autocomplete-brackets = TrueOrFalse

If True, Leo will immediately type the corresponding closing bracket whenever
you type a '(', '[' or '{' character. You can use the forward-char command to
move past the closing bracket, and Leo will move past any closing bracket if you
type the closing bracket with the cursor just to the left of a closing bracket.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051028061322">**Important**: The print-bindings and print-commands commands (new in a1) show
what commands exist and what keys are bound to them.

- The help command tells how to use the minibuffer.

- The show-minibuffer, hide-minibuffer and toggle-mini-buffer commands show and hide the minibuffer.

It *is* possible to execute these command even if the minibuffer isn't presently
visible. For example, typing 

&lt;alt-x&gt;toggle-mini-buffer&lt;return&gt;

should always work.

- The open-find-tab command opens the Find tab. The Find tab replaces the old
Find panel. The Find panel is deprecated.

- The open-spell-tab command opens the Spell-checking tab.

- The show-colors command creates the 'Colors' tab in the log pane. This tab allows you to
experiment with picking fonts.

- The show-fonts command creates the 'Fonts' tab in the log pane. This tab allows you to
experiment with picking colors.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405">At the bottom of Leo's window you will now see an area labelled the mini-buffer.
You can't type in it directly, you activate the buffer by typing Alt-x or Alt-c.
Typing Alt-x takes you to 'full-command' mode. Type the full name of a command,
followed by a 'return'. 

- To get help, type Alt-x help.
- For a list of commands, type Alt-x print-commands.
- For a list of present key bindings, type Alt-x print-bindings.
- To leave the mini-buffer at any time type Ctrl-g.

Note: you can redefine any of these keys as you wish.

Important: you can execute any of Leo's 'legacy' commands from the mini-buffer.
For example, Alt-x about-leo or Alt-x open-find-dialog. Note: Leo's Find
*dialog* is deprecated. You will find it much more convenient to use Leo's new
Find *tab*. Use the open-find-tab command.

You can use tab-completion in the minibuffer to cycle through the list of
commands that start with what is in the buffer. Typing backspace takes you back
to the what you previously typed (less on character.) The 'Completion' tab shows
all possible completions. This tab appears automatically when you type a tab in
the minibuffer.

The mini-buffer reduces the need for shortcuts dramatically. For example, none
of Leo's import commands need a shortcut because it is easy enough to execute
them from the minibuffer. In particular, executing commands from the minibuffer
is much easier than executing commands by hand from a menu. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.1">leoSettings.leo contains one functional @shortcuts node and one disabled
@@shortcuts node. These node contain entries for every command.

You can assign key shortcuts to any command, as discussed in the comments in
that file. You can leave the nodes as they are, use them as base for
modifications, or roll your own. You should define a binding for every function,
even if that binding is 'None'. If you don't, Leo will issue a warning.

Leo now supports per-pane bindings.  Bindings of the form:

command-name ! pane = shortcut

bind the shortcut to the command only withing a single pane. The possible values
for 'pane' are:

pane    affected panes
----    --------------
all     body,log,tree
body    body
log     log
mini    minibuffer
text    body,log
tree    tree</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.2">The scripting plugin has been improved in two ways:

1. You can specify key bindings in @button nodes as follows:

@button name @key=shortcut

This binds the shortcut to the script in the script button. The button's name is
'name', but you can see the full headline in the status line when you move the
mouse over the button.

2. You can create new minibuffer commands with @command nodes:

@command name @key=shortcut

This creates a new minibuffer command and binds shortcut to it.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161405.3">Abbreviations may not work at present. A new kind of abbreviation is presently
hard coded in add_ekr_altx_commands in leoKeys.py. For example, one ekr-shortcut
is: 'f', which is bound to leo-find-panel. Typing Alt-x f Return executes
leo-find-panel. These may be quicker than Emacs abbreviations, or not.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101161949"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162123">These 'hard-coded' bindings are no longer needed and interfere with per-pane bindings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162123.1">- The open-find-tab command opens the Find tab.

- The open-spell-tab command opens the Spell-checking tab.

The Find and Spell *tabs* replace the corresponding legacy *dialogs*. Using tabs
eliminates previous problems with dialogs obscuring Leo's main window.

Two essential components of the settings dialog now are implemented in the tabbed log:

- The show-colors command creates the 'Colors' tab in the log pane.

- The show-fonts command creates the 'Fonts' tab in the log pane.

These two tabs allow you to pick color or font names without using the @settings dialog.

Important: scripts and plugins can easily create new tabs in the Log pane. See
Chapter 7 of the Users Guide for details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051101162947">Leo's core now supports tabs in the log pane.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20051101182739">- The node::

    @shortcuts traditional Leo shortcuts with important emacs bindings

contains Leo key bindings.

- The spelling settings in leoSettings.leo replace the settings in spellpyx.ini.

- You can specify the background of tabs using the following pattern::

    @color log_pane_XXX_tab_background_color = aColor

For example::

    @color log_pane_Find_tab_background_color = #d6c7d3

- The @bool autocomplete-brackets setting controls whether Leo types a matching
closing bracket immediately when you type '(', '[' or '{'.</t>

The new default binding causes focus to move to the body pane when the user hits

This was not, in fact, a problem with the plugins manager plugin.

The bug was in &lt;&lt; put up a dialog requiring a valid id &gt;&gt; in app.setLeoID.
The code set g.app.gui to None after calling g.app.gui.runAskLeoIDDialog the code set!

While I was at it, Leo's core now always inits Pmw when creating Tk.Tk. This
removes the necessity for Plugins to do this.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.1">- Up-Down Arrow moves the selection up or down.
- Tab inserts the current selection.

The completion list shows the best prefix entered after the '.'
Any other key withdraws the autocompleter.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.2">Enter
    Processes the current line from the prompt to the end,
    regardless of where the cursor is.

Ctrl Enter
    This keystroke has two meanings:

    1. process the current line with a ':' appended to the end of it,
       regardless of where the cursor is.
       This is the behavior if there is character data on the line.

    2. If the line is pure whitespace, then the line is interpreted as a '' string with a length of 0.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.3">Executing will dynamically expand a prefix to matching
words already entered within the interpreter.  For example:
cactus
cac( keystroke ) will expand cac to cactus.
This will cycle through all matches to cac within the buffer upon repeated execution.

Ctrl A 
    Moves current position to the end of the prompt.

Ctrl E
    Moves current position to the end of the line.

Ctrl K
    Removes all text from current position to end of the line.

Ctrl N
    Start typing, and then use this keystroke to search downwards only through
    the history items that match what you've typed so far. If you use this
    keystroke at a blank prompt, they just behave like normal arrow keys.

Ctrl P
    Start typing, and then use this keystroke to search upwards through only the
    history items that match what you ve typed so far. If you use this keystroke
    at a blank prompt, they just behave like normal arrow keys.

Ctrl R
    Opens a search prompt. Begin typing and the system searches your history for
    lines that contain what you ve typed so far, completing as much as it can.

Ctrl T
    Places triple quotes around the text on the current line.

Ctrl Z
    Suppresses the current output for the duration of the execution statement.
    This is useful in cases where there is a tremendous amount of output
    occuring and the user decides that he no longer wishes to see all of it. For
    gigantic outputs, this can be a shell saver.

Delete
    Removes all text from the prompt to the end of the line.

Down
    Moves the current line down one item in the history.
    By moving, this means the current line is replaced with history item.

Up
    Moves the current line up one item in the history
    By moving, this means the current line is replaced with history item.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203085709.4">Typing a reference name followed by a ? will create a object view which gives
the user a variety of information about the Object in question. Example::

    a = 'meoooowwww'
    a? # Upon Enter, a panel will appear below showing Object information.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203090220">Typing ! at the command prompt followed by the system command you wish to
execute will start the command as a process and return a JPID for the process
that can be manipulated by the magic command set.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203090220.1">Entering one of the following commands will cause its
corresponding command to execute:</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203090220.2">JPIDs are not PIDs of the OS. They are a system by which the JythonShell can
keep track of Processes created by it, and means by which the user can
manipulate those Processes.

The CWD does not indicate what the process is working in. It is intended to
function with the Magic Commands. This system does not interoperate with
java.io.File or Jython open. To achieve interopability the user should use the
magic command of the form::

    %cwd reference

This will place a java.io.File in the reference. The File instance is a copy of
the CWD File and will allow the user to open, write, create, close streams and
such in the JythonShell's CWD</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203094826">``%alias`` *anAlias* defines alias name as an alias for cmd.
Afterwards, typing alias name params will execute the system command cmd params (from your
underlying operating system).
Aliases have lower precedence than magic functions and Python normal variables,
so if foo is both a Python variable and an alias, the alias can not be executed until you remove the Python using ``del foo``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203094826.1">Toggles autocalling off and on.
Autocalling is the ability to do something like::

    dir a

instead of dir( a ).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203094826.2">Toggles autoindenting off and on.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113">Runs a method/function in a background thread.
For example::

    %bg doit()

This executes doit in a thread.
The status of the operation can be seen by looking at the jobs object::

    jobs.status()  #Prints the status of the jobs.

Alternatively you can access the status like so::

    jobs[jobnumber].result

jobnumber is printed out when the method/function is about to execute.
The result will be the return value of the method/function or it will tell you the job isn't finished yet.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.1">Changes the current working directory of the Jython Shell.
``..`` signifies the parent directory.
Absolute and relative paths are allowed.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.2">Destroys all JPIDs.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.3">Clears the shell of all text and starts over with a fresh prompt.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.4">Shows the current working directory of the Jython Shell.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095113.5">Sets the reference to a java.io.File instance representing the current directory.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437">Deserialize an Object stored on disk into the reference.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.1">Same as %edit.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.2">Brings up the Jython Shell editor and executes the resulting code.

This command allows you to conveniently edit multi-line code right in your JythonShell session.
If called without arguments,
``%edit`` opens up an empty editor with a temporary file and will execute the contents of this file when you close it
(don t forget to save it!).
Options:

-p
    Calls the editor with the same data as the previous time it was used,
    regardless of how long ago (in your current session) it was.

-x
    Suppresses execution of the edited code upon exit.
    This is mainly useful if you are editing programs which need to be called with command line arguments,
    which you can then do using %run.

If args are given, the following possibilites exist:

- The arguments are numbers or pairs of colon-separated numbers, e.g., ``1 4:8 9``.
  These are interpreted as lines of previous input to be loaded into the editor.
  The syntax is the same of the %macro command.

- If the argument doesn't start with a number,
  it is evaluated as a variable and its contents loaded into the editor.
  You can thus edit any string which contains python code (including the result of previous edits).</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.3">Prints all environment variables.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.4">Prints all or part of the history.
If given, the ``-n`` argument signifies that line numbers should not be printed out.

%hist [ -n ] 
    Prints the total history or the last 40 items in it.

%hist [ -n ] n1
    Prints the last n1 items in the history.

%hist [ -n ] n1 n2
    Prints the items from index n1 to index n2.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.5">Destroys JPID n.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.6">Shows the contents of the current working directory.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203095437.7">Shows a java array of File instances.  For example::

    %ls a # a now holds a java array of File instances</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230">Returns the current available set of magic commands.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.1">Defines a macro that can be executed by using the name given.  For example::

    %macro macex 9:10 11 12:13 4

creates a macro called macex and puts line 9-10, 11 12-13 and 4 from the history into it
Hence entering macex and typing enter will cause those lines to rexecute.

To see the contents of the macro type: ``print macroname``.
To remove a macro type: ``del macroname``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.2">%magic
    Prints out the description of the magic commands.

%magic %magiccommandname
    Prints the usuage/description of the given magic command.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.3">Same as 'print'.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.4">%pdb
    Starts the Pdb debugger.

%pdb filename

    Runs the file under Pdb in the shell.

%pdb [on|1|off|0 ]
    Toggles automatic startup of Pdb on an exception.  Examples::

        %pdb on  --&gt; now on
        %pdb off --&gt; now off
        %pdb 1 --&gt; now on
        %pdb 0 --&gt; now off</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.5">Prints out the doc string of the passed in object if one can be found, otherwise does nothing.

The object may be a module, a method, an object, etc.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.6">Attempts to locate the source file of the passed in object
and displays the contents of the source in the shell.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.7">An alias for the ? object viewer syntax.
If the references is valid, a widget containing info on the reference will appear.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.8">Executes a statement entered on the same line in the profile module.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.9">%ps
    Prints out all JPID's the JythonShell has collected.

%ps aReference
    Puts a java Set of Processes in the reference.  For exampe:

        %ps a #a now holds a Set of Processes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100230.10">Repeats the last input.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.1">%rehash
    Updates the alias table with all entries in $PATH.
    This command does **not** check execute permissions or whether the contents of $PATH are truly files
    (instead of directories or something else).

%rehashx
    Updates the alias table with all executable files in $PATH.
    This command **does** explicitly check that every entry in $PATH is a file, so it is slower than %rehash.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.2">Resets the namespace by removing all names defined by the user.
Input/Output history remain in case you need them.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.3">Runs the named file inside IPython as a program. Options:

-n:
    Suppresses setting ``__name__`` to ``__main__``.
    Instead, sets ``__name__`` to the file's name without
    extension (as Python does under import).

    This allows running scripts and reloading the definitions in them without calling code protected by::

        if __name__ == __main__:

-i:
    Runs the file in JythonShell's namespace instead of an empty one.
    This is useful if you are experimenting with code written in a text editor which
    depends on variables defined interactively.

-t:
    Prints timing information at the end of the run.

-N n:
    If -t is given this option indicates how many times you want the script to run.
    ``n`` must be an integer.
    The final timing report will include total and per run results.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.4">This command uses the same syntax as %macro for line extraction, but instead
of creating a macro it saves the resulting string to file whose name is
given. It ensures the filename ends with a .py extension, and it asks for
confirmation before overwriting existing files.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.6">Runs the given command using ``command.getoutput()``
and updates the user's interactive namespace with a variable called varname
containing the value of the call.
Your command can contain shell wildcards, pipes, etc.
The ``=`` is mandatory, and the variable name must be a valid Python identifier.
Options:

-l:
    List output. Splits the output on newlines into a list before
    assigning it to the given variable. By default the output is stored as a
    single string.

-v:
    Verbose. Prints the contents of the variable.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203100930.7">%see n
    Shows any output JPID n has collected.

%see n aReference
    Places any output JPID n has collected in the reference.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658">Sends the reference as input to JPID n.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658.1">Saves the object referenced by reference as a serialized Object.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658.2">Places the reference into the editor if the reference is a JComponent subclass.
Useful for quick gazing of what a Swing component looks like.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101658.3">Runs the given command using commands.getoutput(), and returns the result formatted as a list (split on).
The output is stored in ipython's regular output cache Out[N] and in the N automatic variables.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828">Shows the threads running and the state they are in.
Selecting a thread shows the thread's stack.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.1">Removes the given alias.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.2">Loads data from a url into a reference.  For example::

    %url a http://python.org

take the data at ``http://python.org`` and places it in ref.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.3">Suspends the JythonShell until JPID n has finished.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.4">Prints the list of identifiers that have been defined interactively.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.5">Returns a sorted list of all interactive variables.
If arguments are given, only variables of types matching these arguments are returned.
Examples::

    %who_ls
    %who_ls str int  #this prints out variables whose type is str and int</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.6">Prints a table of identifiers that have been defined interactively.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20051203101828.7">Transforms reference ref2 with the stylesheet in ref1 putting the result in ref3.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20051205091625">- The abbreviation and buffer commands are not ready yet.

- repeat-complex-command does not work.

- Moving the cursor when the 'mark' has been defined does not expand the visibly
selected text.

- Yanking and killing have not been well tested.

- C-u 5 &lt;return&gt; works but is not undone properly. Also, the kill-line command
does not work as in Emacs.

- Many new commands must be generalized to handle the more complex environment
Leo offers. For example, search commands must be told whether to limit the
search a single node, or a node or and its descendants, or the entire outline.
We need a set-variable command that sets a (Python) variable using an
emacs-style variable name.

- The notion of the 'point' must be expanded so it indicates a node as well as
text location.
    
- New commands are needed to support 'mouseless-Leo'. The user must be able to
drive all dialogs from the keyboard, or to get the same effect without using a
dialog at all. Examples: dismiss-top-dialog, scroll-outline-up/down. We also
need commands to change focus and to manage menus. Examples: focus-in-body,
focus-in-tree, etc, activate-edit-menu, etc.</t>

This release completes the last major features of Leo 4.4:

- User-specified key-binding modes.
- Support for multiple key-bindings for individual minibuffer commands.

This will be the last alpha version of Leo 4.4. Beta 1 is coming in about a
week. You should be able to use this version safely; there are no known serious
bugs.

To learn about Leo, see: http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
----------------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name. Support for tab completion.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Support for most commands in the Emacs Cmds menu, including cursor and screen
movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and commands to
manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles.

- Per-pane key bindings. You can bind shortcuts to multiple commands depending
on which of Leo's panes presently has focus. For example, you can use arrow keys
to move nodes in the outline pane, while retaining their defaults in Leo's body
pane.

- User-specified key-binding modes. This feature makes it possible to emulate all
aspects of Emacs and Vim as far as key bindings are concerned.

- @command nodes create minibuffer commands. You can bind key shortcuts to
@button and @command nodes.

- Leo recovers from crashes much more reliably than in any previous version.

- Leo handles keystrokes and updates the screen immediately rather than waiting
for idle time.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20051219150602.105">Leo now supports the following commands, shown below with their present bindings:

back-char ! text = LtArrow
back-char-extend-selection ! text = Shift-LtArrow
back-paragraph ! text = Alt-braceleft 
back-paragraph-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-braceleft
back-sentence ! text = Alt-a 
back-sentence-extend-selection  = None
back-word ! text = Alt-b  # No conflict   
back-word-extend-selection  ! text = Alt-Shift-b
beginning-of-buffer ! text = Alt-less # Note: same as Alt-Shift-less
beginning-of-buffer-extend-selection  = None
beginning-of-line ! text = Ctrl-a
beginning-of-line-extend-selection = None
exchange-point-mark = None
forward-char ! text = RtArrow
forward-char-extend-selection ! text = Shift-RtArrow
forward-paragraph ! text = Alt-braceright
forward-paragraph-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-braceright
forward-sentence ! text = Alt-e
forward-sentence-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-e
forward-word ! text = Alt-f
forward-word-extend-selection ! text = Alt-Shift-f
next-line ! text = DnArrow
next-line-extend-selection  ! text = Shift-DnArrow
previous-line ! text = Uparrow
previous-line-extend-selection ! text = Shift-UpArrow

The -extend-selection variants move the cursor and also extend the selection
from the insert point in the indicated direction. As usual exchange-point-mark
switches the insert point from one side of the selection to the other: which
side of the selection the insert point is on does make a difference.

I also added three commands that implement so-called 'extend mode':

clear-extend-mode = None
set-extend-mode = None
toggle-extend-mode = None

When extend mode is on (it is off at first), all cursor movement commands listed
above extend the selection. Very handy. Thanks to Brian for this suggestion.

This is the start of mouseless Leo. For the first time all the common Emacs
cursor-movement commands exist. These commands should work in any text widget.</t>

any errors or any other suggestions for these settings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060105145125">You must install the Aspell package if you want to use Leo's Spell tab.

1.  Download and install the Aspell package from http://aspell.sourceforge.net/
    Typically this will create a directory called Aspell/bin

2.  If you are using Python 2.3 or Python 2.4 you must copy a dll
    from Leo's extensions folder to the Aspell/bin directory.
    This step is *not* needed if you are using Python 2.5 or later.
    Leo's extensions folder comes with two dll's: aspell23.pyd and aspell24.pyd,
    for Python 2.3 and 2.4 respectively.
    Make a copy of the appropriate dll, **rename it** to be aspell.pyd,
    and copy the renamed aspell.pyd file to Aspell/bin.

3.  Specify the location of the Aspell and Aspell/bin directories using
    the aspell_dir and aspell_bin_dir settings in LeoSettings.leo.

Important: you can use the show-colors and show-fonts commands to help set
colors and fonts in leoSettings.leo.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060105214753">Leo now allows you to specify input modes. You enter mode ``x`` with the
``enter-x-mode`` command. The purpose of a mode is to create different bindings
for keys within a mode. Often plain keys are useful in input modes.

You can specify modes with ``@mode`` nodes in leoSettings.leo. ``@mode`` nodes work
just like ``@shortcuts`` nodes, but in addition they have the side effect of
creating the ``enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode`` command.

Notes:

- You can exit any mode using the ``keyboard-quit`` (Control-g) command. This is the
  **only** binding that is automatically created in each mode. All other bindings
  must be specified in the ``@mode`` node. In particular, the bindings specified in
  @shortcuts nodes are **not** in effect in mode (again, except for the
  keyboard-quit binding).

- Leo supports something akin to tab completion within modes: if you type a key
  that isn't bound in a mode a 'Mode' tab will appear in the log pane. This tab
  shows all the keys that you can type and the commands to which they are bound.
  The mode-help command does the same thing.

- ``@shortcuts`` nodes specify the bindings for what might be called the 'top-level'
  mode. These are the bindings in effect when no internal state is present, for
  example, just after executing the keyboard-quit command.

- The ``top_level_unbound_key_action`` setting determines what happens to
  unbound keys in the top-level mode. Leo ignores unbound keys in all other modes.
  The possibilities are 'insert', 'replace' and 'ignore'.

- The ``set-insert-mode``, ``set-overwrite-mode`` and ``set-ignore-mode``
  commands alter what happens to unbound keys in the top-level mode.

With all these options it should be possible to emulate the keyboard behavior of any other editor.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060111192108">A **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node is deleted *everywhere* in an outline.  The data is gone, to be retrieved only via undo or via backups.  It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an outline containing clones.  Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb::

    Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.
    Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.

We could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being omitted from a derived file.**  This can happen as follows.  Suppose we have the following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark)::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B

Now suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
            - B'
    - Projects
        - A'
            - B'
        - B'

If (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get::

    - @thin spam.py
        - A'
    - Projects
        - A'
        - B

B has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @thin spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.</t>

The code is stable; there are no known serious bugs. Some features are
incomplete.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

True, a screen redraw shouldn't mess with the focus,

   - The allocation code just gets *any* previously allocated widget.

<t tx="ekr.20060211104746.12">* Found the reason why focus was *still* sticking in the outline pane:
    - The click handlers must return 'break', not continue.
    - However, OnActivateHeadline must return 'continue' when the headline is active
      so that Tk will handle the click properly.

- UNL does not seem to be causing problems.

- No need to save/restore focus in status line.

- Added several new traces to tkTree class.

* tree.redraw_now now ends editing properly. This fixes lots of bugs. In
particular, it avoid any chance that p.edit_widget won't correspond to the

- k.masterClickHandler calls tree.OnDeactivate() if there is no callback function.

<t tx="ekr.20060212102459.4">All minibuffer search commands, with the exception of the isearch (incremental) commands, simply provide a minibuffer interface to Leo's legacy find commands.  This means that all the powerful features of Leo's legacy commands are available to the minibuffer search commands.

Note: all bindings shown are the default bindings for these commands.  You may change any of these bindings using @shortcuts nodes in leoSettings.leo.

Settings

leoSettings.leo now contains several settings related to the Find tab:

- @bool show_only_find_tab_options = True

When True (recommended), the Find tab does not show the 'Find', 'Change', 'Change, Then Find', 'Find All' and 'Change All' buttons.

- @bool minibufferSearchesShowFindTab = True

When True, Leo shows the Find tab when executing most of the commands discussed below.  It's not necessary for it to be visible, but I think it provides good feedback about what search-with-present-options does.  YMMY.  When True, the sequence Control-F, Control-G is one way to show the Find Tab.

Basic find commands

- The open-find-tab command makes the Find tab visible.  The Find tab does **not** need to be visible to execute any search command discussed below.

- The hide-find-tab commands hides the Find tab, but retains all the present settings.

- The search-with-present-options command (Control-F) prompts for a search string.  Typing the &lt;Return&gt; key puts the search string in the Find tab and executes a search based on all the settings in the Find tab.   This command is my 'workhorse' search command.

- The show-search-options command shows the present search options in the status line.  At present, this command also shows the Find tab.

Search again commands

- The find-tab-find command (F3) is the same as the search-with-present-options command, except that it uses the search string in the find-tab.  This is what I use as my default 'search again' command.

- Similarly, the find-tab-find-previous command (F2) repeats the command specified by the Find tab, but in reverse.

- The find-again command a combination of the search-with-present-options and find-tab-find command.  It is the same as the find-tab-find command if a search pattern other than '&lt;find pattern here&gt;' exists in the Find tab.  Otherwise, the find-again is the same as the search-with-present-options command.

Setting find options

- Several minibuffer commands toggle the checkboxes and radio buttons in the Find tab, and thus affect the operation of the search-with-present-options command. Some may want to bind these commands to keys. Others, will prefer to toggle options in a mode.


Here are the commands that toggle checkboxes: toggle-find-ignore-case-option, toggle-find-in-body-option, toggle-find-in-headline-option, toggle-find-mark-changes-option, toggle-find-mark-finds-option, toggle-find-regex-option, toggle-find-reverse-option, toggle-find-word-option, and toggle-find-wrap-around-option.

Here are the commands that set radio buttons: set-find-everywhere, set-find-node-only, and set-find-suboutline-only.

- The enter-find-options-mode (Ctrl-Shift-F) enters a mode in which you may change all checkboxes and radio buttons in the Find tab with plain keys.  As always, you can use the mode-help (Tab) command to see a list of key bindings in effect for the mode.

Search commands that set options as a side effect

The following commands set an option in the Find tab, then work exactly like the search-with-present-options command.

- The search-backward and search-forward commands set the 'Whole Word' checkbox to False.

- The word-search-backward and word-search-forward set the 'Whole Word' checkbox to True.

- The re-search-forward and re-search-backward set the 'Regexp' checkbox to True.

Find all commands

- The find-all command prints all matches in the log pane.

- The clone-find-all command replaces the previous 'Clone Find' checkbox.  It prints all matches in the log pane, and creates a node at the beginning of the outline containing clones of all nodes containing the 'find' string.  Only one clone is made of each node, regardless of how many clones the node has, or of how many matches are found in each node.

Note: the radio buttons in the Find tab (Entire Outline, Suboutline Only and Node only) control how much of the outline is affected by the find-all and clone-find-all commands.

Search and replace commands

The replace-string prompts for a search string.  Type &lt;Return&gt; to end the search string.  The command will then prompt for the replacement string.  Typing a second &lt;Return&gt; key will place both strings in the Find tab and executes a **find** command, that is, the search-with-present-options command.

So the only difference between the replace-string and search-with-present-options commands is that the replace-string command has the side effect of setting 'change' string in the Find tab.  However, this is an extremely useful side effect, because of the following commands...

- The find-tab-change command (Ctrl-=) replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab.

- The find-tab-change-then-find (Ctrl--) replaces the selected text with the 'change' text in the Find tab, then executes the find command again.

The find-tab-find, find-tab-change and find-tab-change-then-find commands can simulate any kind of query-replace command.  **Important**: Leo presently has separate query-replace and query-replace-regex commands, but they are buggy and 'under-powered'.  Fixing these commands has low priority.

- The find-tab-change-all command changes all occurrences of the 'find' text with the 'change' text.  Important: the radio buttons in the Find tab (Entire Outline, Suboutline Only and Node only) control how much of the outline is affected by this command.

Incremental search commands

Leo's incremental search commands are completely separate from Leo's legacy search commands.  At present, incremental search commands do not cross node boundaries: they work only in the body text of single node.

Coming in Leo 4.4b3: the incremental commands will maintain a list of previous matches.  This allows for

a) support for backspace and
b) an incremental-search-again command.

Furthermore, this list makes it easy to detect the end of a wrapped incremental search.

Here is the list of incremental find commands: isearch-backward, isearch-backward-regexp, isearch-forward and
isearch-forward-regexp.'''</t>

Leo 4.4 b2 was broken on some platforms.  Leo 4.4 a6 should fix those problems
forever.  However, only wider distribution will verify that for certain.

Besides fixing the fatal problems with Leo 4.4b2, this version fixes two minor bugs
and adds some new settings in leoSettings.leo.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4 b2 and a6:
----------------------------
- Smoother user interface.
- New commands that support mouseless Leo.
- Minibuffer search commands provide all features of Leo's legacy search commands.
- User modes are fully functional; you can create special bindings for the minibuffer.
- New master key and click handlers and improved allocation of screen widgets.

Coming in Leo 4.4b3:
--------------------
- A revived chapters plugin.
- Autocompleter Tab.
- Improved incremental searches.

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060217071505.1">The new scheme binds to keystrokes, not commands.  This should be as portable
and robust as all previous versions (except b2, which was broken).

- Created k.completeAllBindings, called last in k.makeAllBindings. This binds
all keystrokes in k.bindingsDict to k.masterKeyHandler with an optional stroke
argument. This allows k.masterKeyhandler to dispense with the problematic call
to k.strokeFromEvent. This is all that is really required. 

- Added code to menu.createMenuEntries that clears the accelerator on MacOS for
any key that isn't a control, alt or command key. This solves the recurring
problems with the Return key. The only effect is that the menu won't mention a
binding that is actually in effect, but apparently that cannot be helped.

- Added g.safeCompareStrings, which may, or may not, fix the crasher when
comparing k.abortAllModesKey to the incoming keystroke in k.masterKeyHandler.
It's a bit tricky to test.

This white paper originally appeared in November 2003 as a series of postings to comp.lang.python.
Many features have been added since then.
I rewrote this paper in February 2006.

Those who use Leo know that it is a superb environment for
programming, authoring and managing data and project.
Leo's power comes from combining just two basic elements:

- The organization power of outlines, including clones.
- The power and simplicity of the Python language.

This paper explains in detail how combining these two features can, in fact,
create immense and largely unexpected power and flexibility.
To summarize:

- Outlines with clones are a superb filing cabinet for organizing text,
  including programs and scripts, or in fact any other information.
  This is the obvious aspect of outlines, but it is by no means the most powerful.

- Scripts can be composed of multiple nodes using noweb markup.
  Not only do outlines organize scripts, but scripts can be composed of outlines.
  In other words, Leo can *compose* scripts by concatenating descendant nodes and sections.
  Leo uses the noweb markup language to compose scripts in a flexible manner.

- Outline nodes split text, including programs and scripts, into *easily accessible*, discreet parts.
  Scripts may access nodes and their headlines and body text without any parsing.

- Nodes provide an easy associating the *description* of data with the data itself.
  Indeed, headlines naturally describe the node's body text.
  Leo's users have discovered many ways to take advantage of the unification of data and its description.

- Programs may treat nodes as *separate objects*, no matter what data the nodes contain.
  Because nodes are truly separate objects,
  it becomes easy and natural to define new *operations* on those objects,
  **based on the description of those outline found in the node's headline**.

The combination of these features created a chain reaction of creative uses for outlines.
The result has been an explosion of new ideas and capabilities.

Leo supports the following kinds of 'special' nodes:
@test, @suite, @script, @url, @button, @button timer, @rst, @command, etc.
Each of these kinds of nodes defines new objects and new operations on those objects.
The following paragraph show how Leo's users can use these new objects and their operations

Scripting

- The execute script command executes the body text of the presently selected node
  in an environment containing three variables: ``c``, ``g`` and ``p``.
  Thus, all scripts have full and *easy* access to all data in the outline containing the script.

- The scripting plugin creates support for script nodes.
  We can treat a node as a script, and *apply that script to any other part of an outline*.
  This is called 'bringing scripts to data'.
  Leo's users can do this using script buttons as follows.
  Any @button node creates a script button in Leo's icon area.
  The name of the button is the node's headline; the script is the node's body text.
  The user can also create new script buttons using the 'Script Button' button.
  Pressing the 'Script Button' button creates a new script button,
  just as if the presently selected node were an @button node.
  Bringing scripts to data is an immensely powerful and useful feature:
  it has eliminated the need for Leo's previous script-find features.

- @command nodes create new minibuffer commands, complete with keyboard shortcuts.
  The headline defines the command name and an optional keyboard shortcut;
  the body text defines the command.

Unit testing

- We can treat a node as an individual unit test,
  and *automatically* create a subclass of UnitTest.TestCase for the script in that node.
  This is Leo's @test node feature.
  Leo will convert the body text of any @test node into a unit tests.

- Similarly, @suite nodes create suites of unit tests using the script in the @suite node.

- A unit test can get test data from any node in the outline in which it resides.
  Thus, outlines can contain not only unit tests, but the data for those tests.

Text formatting

- The rst3 plugin creates support for @rst nodes.
  @rst trees use outline structure to create document structure.
  This is a revolution in organizing documents.
  Full details [ref]

Organizing data

- @url nodes contain references to web addresses, including files on a local disk.
  Double-clicking an @url node opens a web browser on the given URL.

Plugins

- Plugins support many other kinds of user-defined objects and their associated operations.
  Some examples are @view, @read-only, @folder, @produce, @run, @startfile, etc.
  Writing plugins is easy.
  Python makes the programming as easy as possible;
  and Leo provides plugins with easy access to outlines and their data.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.1">The body text of any Leo node may contain a Python script.
The Execute Script commands executes this script in a in an environment,
that predefines three variables: ``c``, ``g`` and ``p``.
These variables allow easy access to all the data in the present outline.
For example: the following script prints all the node of the
outline in which the script is embedded::

    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        indent = ' '*p.level()
        print '%s + %s' % (indent,p.headString()) # print the node's headline.
        print p.bodyString() # print the node's body.

For that matter, scripts can access any data anywhere on your hard drive, or all
the data available on the web, for that matter. You knew that, but this
"innocent" fact will be important later.

**Result 1**:  Leo is a great environment in which to write Python scripts.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.2">Leo's outline can organize any text (or other data for that matter).

**Result 2**:  Leo is a great way to organize standalone scripts.

This seemingly simple result will turn out to have important implications.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.3">As shown in the example above, scripts may get access to the
headline or body text of any node in a Leo outline.  Therefore, scripts may
use the *structure* of the outline to gain access to

a) other scripts,
b) fragments of code for exec or eval or
c) other data.

**Result 3**: Scripts have can treat outline structure as first-class data.

The first "big" reason why the combination of Python &amp; Leo is spectacular.
It gets better...</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.4">The body text of a node is the perfect place data itself (including other
scripts).  The headline of the node is the perfect place to *describe* the
data.  That is, headlines are a natural place for meta-data.  Scripts can
use this meta-data in many creative ways.

**Result 4**: Scripts have easy access to user-definable meta-data.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.5">I first saw the power of results 2, 3 and 4 when creating unit tests for Leo.
Indeed, the body text of a node is the perfect place for putting regression test
data. Headlines describe the data, which is exactly what is needed for
organizing tests. Indeed, I use a script to create regression tests based on the
structure of the outline of the children of the node containing the script (!)

For example, I run the following script to create and run unit tests of
Leo's colorizer::

    import unittest,leoTest
    suite = leoTest.makeColorSuite("colorizerTests","tempNode")
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite)
    
This works as follows:  the arguments to makeColorSuite tell it to look up
the tree for of an ancestor of the present node (the node containing this
script) for a node whose headline is "colorizerTests".  makeColorSuite then
looks for children of *that* node for nodes containing test data.  The node
whose headline is "tempNode" is used by the colorizer during the tests.
Here is the actual code of makeColorSuite::

    def makeColorSuite(testParentHeadline,tempHeadline):
        """Create a colorizer test for every descendant of testParentHeadline."""
        u = testUtils() ; c = top() ; v = c.currentVnode()
        root = u.findRootNode(v)
        temp_v = u.findNodeInTree(root,tempHeadline)
        vList = u.findSubnodesOf(testParentHeadline)
        # Create the suite and add all test cases.
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        for v in vList:
            test = colorTestCase(c,v,temp_v)
            suite.addTest(test)
        return suite
    
The power and simplicity of this code is breathtaking.  All that is required
are two utility routines, findNodeInTree and findSubnodesOf that find
various nodes in an outline based on the outline structure and the headlines
of the nodes:

- findNodeInTree(root,tempHeadline) returns the node in the entire tree
  contain the current node whose headline is tempHeadline.

- u.findSubnodesOf(testParentHeadline) returns a list of all children of the
  node whose name is testParentHeadline.

In short, it is absolutely trivial for a script embedded in a Leo outline to
generate unit tests based on the data in the outline in which the script is
embedded!

Notice, please, what does *not* have to be done:

A. No unit tests are created statically: everything is driven by data (the
   outline itself)

B. No Python test data is created *at all*.   Before I saw this approach, I
   was putting text for the syntax-coloring text in Python strings and passing
   those strings to the regression tests.  Now, the *unchanged* data in the
   body text of nodes becomes the regression test data.

C.  There is no need to mark meta-data as separate from test data: headlines
are naturally distinct from body text.

We see now that Reasons 2, 3 and 4 are a lot more potent than they might
appear at first.  Indeed, Leo plus Python is the ultimate merging of code,
structure and data.   Scripts can use data organized in outlines.  Outlines
organize scripts.  Outlines (particularly their structure) are *data* for
scripts.  Outlines contains metadata for scripts.  Outlines naturally keep
data and meta-data separate.

Please notice, this discussion merely hints at all the games that scripts
could play with outline structure.  Just for example, scripts can easily
insert, delete and reorganize nodes.  And the uses to which outline
structure may be put are practically unlimited, as we shall see later...

Let's turn now to a completely separate topic...</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.6">A few days ago I have added a script-based option to Leo's Find/Change
panel.  For more than 30 years I have been disgusted with tools like regular
expressions.  Calling re powerful is an utter joke; it's way too complex and
way too wimpy.  Script-based find-change is infinitely more powerful.
Instead of containing find text or change *text*, Leo's Find/Change panel
may contains find or change *scripts*.  This becomes possible because scripts
have complete access to both the structure of the outline and all of Leo's
code.

It all works so smoothly:   The find script is responsible for traversing
the tree and for highlighting the found text or otherwise indicating to the
change script what the found text was.  Leo dedicates a Python dict called
app.searchDict for communication between the search script and the change
script.  The change script is responsible for:

-  changing the text, typically by using c.setBodyString(p,newText), and

-  implementing undo, typically by calling c.frame.onBodyChanged(p,"Change",oldText=oldText).

Some details:

- When executing the search and change scripts when the user selects the Find
  All or Change All commands, Leo executes the find or change scripts repeatedly
  only if app.searchDict.get("continue") evaluates to True. Otherwise these
  scripts are only executed once. Otherwise, scripts can use app.searchDict as
  they please.

- For simplicity, most find and change scripts will ignore settings in the Find
  Panel like "whole word", "pattern match", and "reverse": the scripts know what
  to do! However, these settings are available to the scripts via ivars such as
  c.whole_word_flag, etc. if desired.

- Either the find and change scripts may use Python's re module. For example,
  the find script could set app.searchDict["m"] to the match object returned by
  re's match method. The change script would then compute the result, change the
  text and set the undo info as usual.

In effect, Leo's Find/Change panel becomes a new platform for running
scripts interactively.  Leo now has all the find/change capability of
pattern matching languages like Snobol and Icon, using the capabilities of
the plain Python language.  Moreover, Leo can deliver these capabilities
interactively or not depending which buttons you push in Leo's Find/Change
panel.

One last point.  As I mentioned much earlier, there is no reason to confine
the find and change scripts to operate on data only within a Leo outline.
These scripts could as easily traverse your file system as the Leo outline.
But notice: scripts could pull data from the file system into the outline so
that you can see the effects of changes as the scripts operate.  Again, this
can all happen interactively if you like.

No, one more last point.  It's convenient to defined an initScriptFind
utility very similar to the makeColorSuite utility, used like this::

    # Initialize Leo's find panel using the named children of this node.
    from leoGlobals import *
    initScriptFind("Find script","Change script")
    # Start searching at the top.
    top().selectVnode(c.rootVnode())

Put the search script in a child node called "Find script" (no quotes), put
the change script in a child node called "Change script", execute this
script and the following happens:

- The body text of "Find script" node gets put in the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.

- The body text of "Change script" node gets put in the find text of Leo's Find/Change dialog.

- The Script Find radio buttons gets selected, as does the Script Change checkbox.

- The root of the outline becomes the selected node.

Presto!  Leo is ready for a script search.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.7">One more feature greatly expands the generality and power of
Leo's outlines combined with Python.  Plugins may now attach arbitrary data
to any node of a Leo outline.  This is done merely by "injecting" an ivar
called  unknownAttributes ivar into Leo's fundamental vnode or tnode objects
(or adding items to the unknownAttributes dict if it already exists).  The
unknownAttributes ivar should be a Python dictionary whose keys are xml
attribute names and whose values are the values of those attributes.

When writing a file, Leo will write "foreign" attributes in the &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt;
xml elements of Leo's .leo file if the corresponding vnode or tnode contains
this unknownAttributes ivar.  Similarly, Leo will create an
unknownAttributes ivar for a vnode or tnode if the corresponding &lt;v&gt; or &lt;t&gt;
element contains an attribute not normally used by Leo.  Leo performs the
standard xml escapes when writing unknown attributes, so plugins can put
*anything* in the unknownAttributes dictionary.  In particular, plugins may
put xml in v.unknownAttributes or t.unknownAttributes.

This means, for example, that plugins may add anything that can be
represented by xml (and that is *everything*) in any node of a Leo outline.
In effect, Leo's file format is now completely extensible.  BTW, plugins can
override any aspect of Leo's behavior, so not only can Leo passively accept
the data in "extended" .leo files, but plugins can extend Leo to *use* this
data!</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218085144.8">All the power of Leo derives directly from the power, flexibility and
dynamism of Python.  But making structure explicit as Leo outlines do adds
an important new dimension, literally and figuratively, to Python.
Moreover, Leo's Find/Change dialog creates a new environment from which to
run Python scripts. At long last the full power of the unification of code
and data is becoming apparent.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218092725">See the documentation for the `Rst3 plugin`_ for details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060218095651">Script buttons are a quick way of automating any task.  Extremely useful.

<t tx="ekr.20060227102028.111">Typing a period when @language python is in effect starts autocompletion. Typing
'(' during autocompletion shows the calltip. Typing Return or Control-g
(keyboard-quit) exits autocompletion or calltips.

Autocompletion

Autocompletion shows what may follow a period in code. (Actually you can specify
any character using the auto-complete shortcut setting.) For example, after
typing g. Leo will show a list of all the global functions in leoGlobals.py.
Autocompletion works much like tab completion in the minibuffer. Unlike the
minibuffer, the presently selected completion appears directly in the body
pane.

A leading period brings up 'Autocomplete Modules'. (The period goes away.) You
can also get any module by typing its name. If more than 25 items would appear
in the Autocompleter tab, Leo shows only the valid starting characters. At this
point, typing an exclamation mark shows the complete list. Thereafter, typing
further exclamation marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

If x is a list 'x.!' shows all its elements, and if x is a Python dictionary,
'x.!' shows x.keys(). For example, 'sys.modules.!' Again, further exclamation
marks toggles between full and abbreviated modes.

During autocompletion, typing a question mark shows the docstring for the
object. For example: 'g.app?' shows the docstring for g.app. This doesn't work
(yet) directly for Python globals, but '__builtin__.f?' does. Example:
'__builtin__.pow?' shows the docstring for pow.

Autocompletion works in the Find tab; you can use &lt;Tab&gt; to cycle through the
choices. The 'Completion' tab appears while you are doing this; the Find tab
reappears once the completion is finished.

Calltips

Calltips appear after you type an open parenthesis in code. Calltips shows the
expected arguments to a function or method. Calltips work for any Python
function or method, including Python's global function. Examples:

a)  'g.toUnicode('  gives 'g.toUnicode(s, encoding, reportErrors=False'
b) 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow' gives 'c.widgetWantsFocusNow(w'
c) 'reduce(' gives 'reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -&gt; value'

The calltips appear directly in the text and the argument list is highlighted so
you can just type to replace it. The calltips appear also in the status line for
reference after you have started to replace the args.

Options

Both autocompletion and calltips are initially enabled or disabled by the
enable_autocompleter and enable_calltips settings in leoSettings.leo. You may
enable or disable these features at any time with these commands:
enable-auto-completer-command, enable-calltips-command,
disable-auto-completer-command and disable-calltips-command.</t>

g.os_path_dirname(self.outputFileName) with self.c.frame.openDirectory. This

beta release before 4.4 final.  This release also adds several new commands
and contains a script for updating leoSettings.leo.

Warning: The previous beta was not widely distributed. Please do some testing in

<t tx="ekr.20060417092825.1">See the (presently disabled) script button in scripts.leo at:

Buttons--&gt;@@button updateSettings

From the docstring:

Here is a **preliminary** script that updates a new leoSettings.leo file
(path2) from the settings in a previous leoSettings.leo file (path1).
Presumably, the path2 file is the leoSettings.leo file from a new distribution,
and the path1 file a leoSettings.leo file containing settings that you have
modified.  You must specify the full path of both files in the top-level @button node.

**Warning**: This script modifies the path2 file. Make sure that you don't mind
modifying this file.

**Warning**: This script is unsophisticated in its update algorithm. If if finds
corresponding nodes (node with the same settings name) in both outlines it simply
replaces the node in the path2 file with the node in the path1 file. In
particular, it does not keep track of individual shortcuts: it repaces the body
of one @shortcuts node with the body of the corresponding @shortcuts node.

**Note**: If the path1 file contains a settings node not in the path2 file it
attempts to create a new node in the corresponding place in the path2 file. If
this is not possible, say because the structures of the files are different, the
script places the new node as the last child of the @settings node in the path2
file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060420094611">**New in Leo 4.4**:  The mini-buffer is a text area at the bottom of the body pane.
You use it like the Emacs mini-buffer to invoke commands by their so-called *long name*.
The following commands affect the minibuffer:

- **full-command**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Puts the focus in the minibuffer. Type a
  full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion
  works, but not yet for file names.

- **quick-command-mode**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Like Emacs Control-C. This mode is
  defined in leoSettings.leo. It is useful for commonly-used commands.

- **universal-argument**: (default shortcut: Alt-u) Like Emacs Ctrl-u. Adds a repeat
  count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's.

- **keyboard-quit**: (default shortcut: Ctrl-g) Exits any minibuffer mode and puts
  the focus in the body pane.

For example, to print a list of all commands type Alt-X print-commands &lt;Return&gt;.

The following sections list the various commands that you can invoke from the minibuffer.
**Important**: you may bind keystrokes to any of these commands.

After cutting selection in the headline, headline area shrinks too much.  Example:
headline is 'NewHeadline', select last 'e', ctrl-x, it shrinks to 'Ne'

To fix by hand: add

Just before

w.configure(width=f.tree.headWidth(s=s))

This version fixes a few minor bug reported in 4.4b4 and adds 9 new commands.
The open-outline-by-name command supports filename completion.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060430220749">The jEdit_ editor drives its syntax colorer using xml **language description files.**
`jEdit's documentation`_ contain a complete description of these xml files.
Each xml file describes one **colorizing mode**.
A mode consists of one or more **rulesets**, and each ruleset consists of a list of **colorizing rules**.
In addition, modes, rulesets and rules may have associated **properties** and **attributes**.
Various rules may specify that the colorizer uses another ruleset (either in the same mode or another mode).

**Important**: jEdit's xml language description files contain no explicit ``&lt;RULE&gt;`` elements
Rules are simply sub-elements of an enclosing ``&lt;RULES&gt;`` element.
The element indicates the kind of rule that is specified,
for example, ``&lt;SPAN&gt;``, ``&lt;SEQ&gt;``, etc.
By the term **rule element** we shall mean any sub-element of the ``&lt;RULES&gt;`` element.

Rather than using the xml language description files directly,
Leo uses Python **colorer control files**,
created automatically from the xml files by a script called ``jEdit2Py``.
These Python files contain all the information in the jEdit's xml files,
so we can (loosely) speak of modes, rulesets, rules, properties and attributes in the Python colorer control files. 
Later sections of this documentation will make this loose correspondence exact.

**Important**: throughout this documentation,
**x.py** will refer to the Python colorer for language ``x``,
and **x.xml** will refer to the corresponding xml language-description file.

Using Python colorer control files has the following advantages:

- Running ``jEdit2Py`` need only be done when x.xml changes,
  and the speed of the xml parser in jEdit2Py does not affect the speed of Leo's colorizer in any way.
  Moreover, the ``jEdit2Py`` script can contain debugging traces and checks.

- Colorer control files are valid .py files, so all of Python's import optimizations work as usual.
  In particular, all the data in colorer control files is immediately accessible to Leo's colorer.

- Colorer control files are easier for humans to understand and modify than the equivalent xml file.
  Furthermore, it is easy to insert debugging information into Python colorer control files.

- It is easy to modify the Python colorer control files 'by hand' without changing the corresponding xml file.
  In particular, it would be easy to define entirely new kinds of pattern-matching rules in Python merely
  by creating functions in a colorer control file.</t>

Chapter 15: Controlling Syntax Coloring
#########################################

This chapter discusses how to control Leo's new syntax colorer using Python
files derived from jEdit_'s xml language description files. It also discusses
settings related to syntax coloring.

**Important**: this material is for those who want to support Leo's colorizing
code. You do *not* need to understand this chapter in order to use Leo's
colorizers.

The __jEdit_colorizer__.py plugin was an early prototype of the new colorizer.
This code has been retired. The threading_colorizer.py plugin uses a separate
helper thread to do the colorizing. Coding details for this plugin are discussed
in this chapter.

<t tx="ekr.20060502084233">When Leo's syntax colorer sees the ``'@language x'`` directive,
it will import ``x.py`` from Leo's ``modes`` folder.
The colorer can then access any module-level object ``obj`` in ``x.py`` as ``x.obj``.

Colorizer control files contain **rules functions** corresponding to rule elements in x.xml.
The colorizer can call these functions as if they were members of the colorizer class by
passing 'self' as the first argument of these functions.
I call these rules *functions* to distinguish them from the corresponding
**rules methods** which are actual methods of the colorizer class.
Rules *functions* merely call corresponding rules *methods*.
Indeed, rules functions are simply a way of binding values to keyword arguments of rules methods.
These keywords arguments correspond to the xml attributes of rule elements in x.xml.

The colorizer calls rules functions until one matches, at which point a range of text gets colored and the process repeats.
The inner loop of the colorizer is this code::

    for f in self.rulesDict.get(s[i],[]):
        n = f(self,s,i)
        if n &gt; 0:
            i += n ; break
        else: i += 1

- rulesDict is a dictionary whose keys are rulesets and whose values are ruleset dictionaries.
  Ruleset dictionaries have keys that are single characters and whose values are
  the list of rules that can start with that character. 

- s is the full text to be colorized.

- i is the position within s is to be colorized.

Rules methods (and functions) return n &gt; 0 if they match, and n == 0 if they fail.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502084233.1">The following sections describe the top-level data in ``x.py``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516">**x.properties** is a Python dictionary corresponding to the &lt;PROPS&gt; element in ``x.xml``.
Keys are property names; values are strings, namely the contents of ``&lt;PROPERTY&gt;`` elements in ``x.xml``.
``x.properties`` contains properties for the entire mode.
That is, only modes have ``&lt;PROPS&gt;`` elements.
For example, here is ``x.properties`` in ``php.py``::

    # properties for mode php.xml
    properties = {
        "commentEnd": "--&gt;",
        "commentStart": "&lt;!--",
        "indentCloseBrackets": "}",
        "indentOpenBrackets": "{",
        "lineUpClosingBracket": "true",
    }</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.1">``x.py`` contains a **keyword dictionary** for each ruleset in ``x.xml``.
``x.py`` contains an empty keywords dictionary if a ruleset contains no ``&lt;KEYWORDS&gt;`` element.

Keys are strings representing keywords of the language describe by the mode.
Values are strings representing syntactic categories,
i.e. a ``TYPE`` attribute valid in ``x.xml``, namely:
``COMMENT1``, ``COMMENT2``, ``COMMENT3``, ``COMMENT4``,
``FUNCTION``,
``KEYWORD1``, ``KEYWORD2``, ``KEYWORD3``, ``KEYWORD4``,
``LABEL``, ``LITERAL1``, ``LITERAL2``, ``LITERAL3``, ``LITERAL4``,
``MARKUP``, ``NULL`` and ``OPERATOR``.

For example, here (parts of) some keyword dictionaries in php.py::

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHP
    php_PHP_keywords_dict = {
        "COM_invoke": "keyword2",
        "COM_load": "keyword2",
        "__CLASS__": "keyword3",
        ...
        "abs": "keyword2",
        "abstract": "keyword1",
        "accept_connect": "keyword2",
        ...
    }

    # Keywords dict for mode php::JAVASCRIPT_PHP
    php_JAVASCRIPT_PHP_keywords_dict = {}

    # Keywords dict for mode php::PHPDOC
    php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict = {
        "@abstract": "label",
        "@access": "label",
        "@author": "label",
        ...
        "@var": "label",
        "@version": "label",
    }

``x.py`` also contains **x.keywordsDictDict**.
Keys are ruleset names, values are keywords dictionaries.
Here is ``keywordsDictDict`` for php.py::

    # Dictionary of keywords dictionaries for php mode.
    keywordsDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_keywords_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_keywords_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_keywords_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_keywords_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_keywords_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_keywords_dict,
    }
    
The colorizer can get the keywords dictionary for a ruleset as follows::

    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict(rulesetName)

**Note**:
The ``jEdit2Py`` script creates 'friendly' names for keyword dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code.
Leo's colorer uses only the name ``x.keywordsDictDict``;
Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of keywords dictionaries such as ``php_PHPDOC_keywords_dict``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502090516.2">``x.py`` contains one **rule function** for every rule in every ruleset (``&lt;RULES&gt;`` element) in ``x.xml``.
These rules have names ``rule1`` through  ``ruleN``,
where ``N`` is the total number of rules in all rulesets in ``x.xml``.

Each rules *function* merely calls a rules *method* in Leo's colorizer.
Which method gets called depends on the corresponding element in `x.xml`.
For example, the first rule in php.xml is::

    &lt;SPAN TYPE="MARKUP" DELEGATE="PHP"&gt;
		&lt;BEGIN&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/BEGIN&gt;
		&lt;END&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/END&gt;
	&lt;/SPAN&gt;

and the corresponding rule function is::

    def php_rule0(colorer, s, i):
        return colorer.match_span(s, i, kind="markup", begin="&lt;?php", end="?&gt;",
            at_line_start=False, at_whitespace_end=False, at_word_start=False,
            delegate="PHP",exclude_match=False,
            no_escape=False, no_line_break=False, no_word_break=False)
    

``php_rule0`` calls ``colorer.match_span`` because the corresponding xml rule is a ``&lt;SPAN&gt;`` element.

For each ruleset, ``x.py`` also contains a **rules dictionary**,
a Python dictionary whose keys are characters and whose values are all lists
of rules functions that that can match the key.
For example::

    # Rules dict for phpdoc ruleset.
    rulesDict8 = {
        "*": [rule64,],
        "0": [rule70,],
        "1": [rule70,],
        "2": [rule70,],
        "3": [rule70,],
        "4": [rule70,],
        "5": [rule70,],
        "6": [rule70,],
        "7": [rule70,],
        "8": [rule70,],
        "9": [rule70,],
        "&lt;": [rule65,rule66,rule67,rule68,rule69,],
        "@": [rule70,],
        "A": [rule70,],
        "B": [rule70,],
        ...
        "X": [rule70,],
        "Y": [rule70,],
        "Z": [rule70,],
        "_": [rule70,],
        "a": [rule70,],
        "b": [rule70,],
       ...
        "x": [rule70,],
        "y": [rule70,],
        "z": [rule70,],
        "{": [rule63,],
    }

**Note**: The order of rules in each rules list is important;
it should be the same as rules element in ``x.xml``.

Finally, ``x.py`` contains **x.rulesDictDict**.
Keys are ruleset names, values are rules dictionaries.
The colorer can get the rules list for character ch as follows::

    self.rulesDict = x.rulesDictDict.get(rulesetName) # When a mode is inited.
    ...
    rules = self.rulesDict.get(ch,[]) # In the main loop.

For example, here is the rules dictionary for php.py::

    # x.rulesDictDict for php mode.
    rulesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": rulesDict6,
        "php_javascript_php": rulesDict7,
        "php_main": rulesDict1,
        "php_php": rulesDict4,
        "php_php_literal": rulesDict5,
        "php_phpdoc": rulesDict8,
        "php_tags": rulesDict2,
        "php_tags_literal": rulesDict3,
    }

**Note**:
The ``jEdit2Py`` script creates 'friendly' names for rules lists *solely* as an aid for people reading the code.
Leo's colorer uses only the name ``x.rulesDictDict``;
Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules lists such as ``rulesDict8``,
and Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of rules functions such as ``rule64``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502100550">A **ruleset name** is a Python string having the form ``'x_setname'``,
where ``setname`` is the value of the ``SET`` attribute of the ``&lt;RULES&gt;`` element in ``x.xml``.
For example, the ruleset name of the ruleset whose ``SET`` attribute is ``JAVASCRIPT`` in ``php.xml`` is
``'php_JAVASCRIPT'``.
**Important**: by convention, the ruleset name of the default ``&lt;RULES&gt;`` element is ``'x_main'``;
note that default ``&lt;RULES&gt;`` element have no ``SET`` attributes.

The colorizer uses ruleset names to gain access to all data structures in ``x.py``.
To anticipate a bit, ruleset names are keys into two standard dictionaries,
``x.rulesDict`` and ``x.keywordsDictDict``,
from which the colorizer can get all other information in ``x.py``::

    # The rules list for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    rules = x.rulesDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

    # The keywords dict for the 'JAVASCRIPT' ruleset in php.xml.
    keywordsDict = x.keywordsDictDict('php_JAVASCRIPT')

In fact, ruleset names (and ``x.rulesDict`` and ``x.keywordsDictDict``)
are the **only** names that the colorizer needs to know in order to access all information in ``x.py``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060502122950">This section describes each rules method in Leo's new colorizer.
Rules methods are called by rules functions in colorizer control file;
they correspond directly to rules elements in jEdit's language description files.
In fact, this documentation is a 'refactoring' of `jEdit's documentation`_.

All rule methods attempt to match a pattern at a particular spot in a string.
These methods all return True if the match succeeds.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060503064515">All rule methods take three required arguments and zero or more optional keyword arguments.

Here is a list of the required arguments and their meaning:

- **self**: An instance of Leo's colorizer.

- **s**: The string in which matches may be found.

- **i**: The location within the string at which the rule method looks for a match.

Here is a list of all optional keyword arguments and their meaning:

- **at_line_start**:
  If ``True``, a match will succeed only if ``i`` is at the start of a line.

- **at_whitespace_end**:
  If ``True``, the match will succeed only if ``i`` is at the first non-whitespace text in a line.

- **at_word_start**:
  If ``True``, the match will succeed only if ``i`` is at the beginning of a word.

- **delegate**:
  If non-empty, the value of this argument is a `ruleset name`_.
  If the match succeeds, the matched text will be colored recursively with the indicate ruleset.

- **exclude_match**:
  If ``True``, the actual text that matched will not be colored.
  The meaning of this argument varies slightly depending on whether one or two sequences are matched.
  See the individual rule methods for details.

- **kind**: A string representing a class of tokens, i.e., one of:
  ``'comment1'``, ``'comment2'``, ``'comment3'``, ``'comment4'``, ``'function'``,
  ``'keyword1'``, ``'keyword2'``, ``'keyword3'``, ``'keyword4'``,
  ``'label'``, ``'literal1'``, ``'literal2'``, ``'literal3'``, ``'literal4'``,
  ``'markup'``, ``'null'`` and ``'operator'``.

- **no_escape**:
  If ``True``, the ruleset's escape character will have no effect before the ``end`` argument to ``match_span``.
  Otherwise, the presence of the escape character will cause that occurrence of the end string to be ignored.

- **no_line_break**:
  If ``True``, the match will not succeed across line breaks.

- **no_word_break**:
  If ``True``, the match will not cross word breaks.
  
New in Leo 4.4.1 final: the regular expression rule matchers no longer get a ``hash_char`` argument
because such matchers are called only if the present search pattern starts with ``hash_char``.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060503072213">``x.importDict`` is a Python dictionary.
Keys are ruleset names; values are a list of ruleset names.
For example::

    # Import dict for php mode.
    importDict = {
        "php_javascript_php": ["javascript::main"],
    }

For any ruleset ``R`` whose ruleset name is ``N``, ``x.importDict.get(N)``
is the list of rulesets names whose rulesets appear in
a ``DELEGATE`` attribute of an ``&lt;IMPORT&gt;`` rule element in ``R's`` ruleset.
Such **imported** ruleset are copied to the end of the ``R's`` rules list.
Leo's colorizer does this copying only once, when loading ruleset ``R`` for the first time.

**Note 1**: Loading imported rulesets must be done at 'run time'.
It should definitely not be done by ``jEdit2Py`` at 'compile time';
that would require running ``jEdit2Py`` on *all* .xml files whenever any such file changed.

**Note 2**:  Multiple ``&lt;IMPORT&gt;`` rule elements in a single ruleset are allowed:
delegated rules are copied to the end of ``N's`` rules list in the order they appear in the ruleset.

**Note 3**: The ``DELEGATE`` attribute of ``&lt;IMPORT&gt;`` elements is, in fact,
completely separate from the ``DELEGATE`` attributes of other rules as
discussed in `Arguments to rule methods`_.
Indeed, the ``DELEGATE`` attribute of ``&lt;IMPORT&gt;`` elements creates entries in
``x.importDict``, which in turn causes the colorizer to append the rules of the imported ruleset
to the end of the present rules list.
In contrast, the ``DELEGATE`` attributes of other rules sets the ``delegate`` argument to rules methods,
which in tern causes the colorizer to recursively color the matched text with the **delegated** ruleset.
In short:

- The rules of **imported** rulesets are appended to the end of another rules list;
  the rules of **delegated** rulesets never are.

- **Imported** ruleset names appear as the values of items in ``x.importDict``;
  **delegated** ruleset names appear as ``delegate`` arguments to rule methods.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060510085547">``x.py`` contains a **attribute dictionary** for each ruleset in ``x.xml``.
Keys are attribute names, values strings representing the values of the attributes.
This dictionary is empty if a ruleset contains no attributes.
The valid keys are:

- ``'default'``: the default token type.  ``'null'`` is the default.

- ``'digit_re'``: a regular expression.
  Words matching this regular expression are colored with the ``digit`` token type.

- ``'ignore_case'``: ``'true'`` or ``'false'``.  Default is ``'true'``.

- ```highlight_digits'``: ``'true'`` or ``'false'``.  Default is ``'true'``.

- ``'no_word_sep'``: A list of characters treated as 'alphabetic' characters when matching keywords.

For example, here is one attribute dictionary in php.py::

    # Attributes dict for php_javascript ruleset.
    php_javascript_attributes_dict = {
        "default": "MARKUP",
        "digit_re": "",
        "highlight_digits": "true",
        "ignore_case": "true",
        "no_word_sep": "",
    }

``x.py`` also contains **x.attributesDictDict**.
Keys are ruleset names, values are attribute dictionaries.
Here is ``attributesDictDict`` for php.py::

    # Dictionary of attributes dictionaries for php mode.
    attributesDictDict = {
        "php_javascript": php_javascript_attributes_dict,
        "php_javascript_php": php_javascript_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_main": php_main_attributes_dict,
        "php_php": php_php_attributes_dict,
        "php_php_literal": php_php_literal_attributes_dict,
        "php_phpdoc": php_phpdoc_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags": php_tags_attributes_dict,
        "php_tags_literal": php_tags_literal_attributes_dict,
    }

**Note**:
The ``jEdit2Py`` script creates 'friendly' names for attribute dictionaries *solely* as an aid for people reading the code.
Leo's colorer uses only the name ``x.attributeDictDict``;
Leo's colorer never uses the actual names of attribute dictionaries.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060511074853">Leo 4.4 Final                                                     May 11, 2006

Leo 4.4 Final is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.
  To enable autocompletion, bind a key to the auto-complete command.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.

<t tx="ekr.20060527103630">**New in Leo 4.4.1**:
A new method has been added to the rst3 plugin to make it more easily to drive
the plugin from scripts::

    def writeNodeToString (self,p=None,ext=None)

writeNodeToString scans p's tree (p defaults to presently selected node) looking for @rst nodes.
When the first @rst node is found, writeNodeToString processes the node as usual, with the following changes:

- @rst need not be followed by a filename; any filename and its extension are *ignored*.

- Only the ``ext`` argument to writeNodeToString determines the type of output produced.
  The valid values for the ``ext`` argument are None (for rst output), '.html', '.pdf', and '.tex'.

- Instead of writing the result to a file, writeNodeToString returns the tuple (p,s),
  where p is the node whose tree produced the output, and s is the output itself.

- writeNodeToString returns after processing at most one @rst node.

Scripts can easily use writeNodeToString to convert @rst trees into various kinds of output.
For example, here is the body of @button rst-&gt;html in LeoDocs.leo::

    import leoPlugins
    rst3 = leoPlugins.getPluginModule('rst3')
    if rst3:
        controller = rst3.controllers.get(c)
        if controller:
            p,s = controller.writeNodeToString(ext='.html')
            print '*' * 40,p
            print s

Notes:

- This script scans the presently selected tree for @rst nodes, just like the @button rst script does.
  In particular, if the presently selected tree does not contain an @rst node the search continues in parent trees.
  When an @rst node is found, it converts the node (and descendants) to html and returns p,
  the found @rst node and s, the html itself.

- The script shown above merely prints the output, but many other actions could be taken.
  In particular, because writeNodeToString returns p it would be possible to write a script that
  would scan multiple @rst nodes.

- None and '.tex' are also valid values for the ext argument to writeNodeToString.
  None converts the @rst tree to a single reStructuredText string, as shown in @button rst-&gt;rst.

- There is some support for ext='.pdf', but this is experimental code.  Expect crashes.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060527112801">The following settings in leoSettings.leo control debugger operation.
The settings shown here will be assumed to be in effect throughout this chapter.

``@string debugger_kind = winpdb``

This setting controls what debugger the 'Debug Script' script button uses.
Eventually this setting will control what debugger the debug command uses.
At present the only valid value is 'winpdb'

``@bool write_script_file = True``

True: The execute script command writes the script to be executed to a file,
then executes the script using Python's execFile function. The script_file_path
setting specifies the path to this file. False (legacy): The execute script
command uses Python's exec command to execute the script.

``@string script_file_path = ../test/scriptFile.py``

The path to the file to be written by the execute-script command. Notes:
    
- This setting has effect only if the write_script_file setting is True.
- Use ``/`` as the path delimiter, regardless of platform.
- The default path is ``../test/scriptFile.py`` if no path is given.
- The path starts at g.app.loadDir, so for example ``../test/scriptFile.py`` is equivalent to ``leo/test/scriptFile.py``.
- The filename should end in ``.py``.

``@string debugger_path`` = None

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060529053407">@ignore can only be used in the root node of @file trees.  It tells Leo to ignore the tree.

The @ignore directive can not be used elsewhere in @thin trees and @file trees
because of the way Leo recreates outlines from derived files. This is an
absolutely crucial restriction and will never go away.
For a few more details, see `Leo 4.0: Eliminating error 'recovery'`_ in `Chapter 9: History of Leo`_.

There are several workaround, as shown in LeoPy.leo:

- keep notes in the outline outside of any derived file.

- Use @all to gather notes in a derived file, as in done in @thin leoProjects.txt.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060602142732">

leoKeys.py handles key bindings.
There are two kinds of bindings, gui bindings and pane bindings.

**Gui bindings** are the actual binding as seen by Tkinter (or whatever gui is in effect).
Leo binds every key that has a binding to k.masterKeyHander.
For Tkinter, a *separate* binding must be made, rather than a single &lt;Key&gt; binding,
because, alas, Tkinter key events provide insufficient enough information
to tell what key actually caused the key event(!)
This is a significant hole in Tkinter's event mechanism.

At present Leo makes gui bindings in several places, all equivalent.
Bindings are made to callbacks, all of which have this form::
    
     def callback(event=None,k=k,stroke=stroke):
        return k.masterKeyHandler(event,stroke)
        
As a result, changing gui bindings actually has no effect whatever.
It would be clearer to have a single place to make these bindings...

In any case, the purpose of these callbacks is to capture the value of 'stroke' so
that it can be passed to k.masterKeyHandler.
This relieves k.masterKeyHandler of the impossible task of computing the stroke from the event.
**Important**:  No function argument is ever passed to k.masterKeyHandler from these callbacks,
because k.masterKeyHandler binds keys to command handlers as described next.

**Pane bindings** are bindings represented by various Python dictionaries in the keyHandlerClass
(see below).
k.masterKeyHandler and its helpers use these dictionaries to call the proper command or mode handler.
This logic is hairy, but it is completely separate from the gui binding logic.

Here are the dictionaries that k.masterKeyHandler uses:

- c.commandsDict:
  Keys are minibuffer command names; values are functions f.

- k.inverseCommandsDict:
  Keys are f.__name__l values are emacs command names.

- k.bindingsDict:
  Keys are shortcuts; values are *lists* of g.bunch(func,name,warningGiven).

- k.masterBindingsDict:
  Keys are pane names: 'all','text',etc. or mode names.
  Values are dicts:  keys are strokes; values are g.Bunch(commandName,func,pane,stroke).
  
- k.modeWidgetsDict:
  Keys are mode names; values are lists of widgets to which bindings have been made.

- k.settingsNameDict:
  Keys are lowercase settings; values are 'real' Tk key specifiers.
  Important: this table has no inverse.

- inverseBindingDict:
  This is *not* an ivar; it is computed by k.computeInverseBindingDict().
  Keys are emacs command names; values are *lists* of shortcuts.</t>

&lt;&lt; Theory of operation of find/change &gt;&gt;

class leoFind:

    """The base class for Leo's Find commands."""

    @others</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060608111953.3">@ The find and change commands are tricky; there are many details that must be handled properly. This documentation describes the leo.py code. Previous versions of Leo used an inferior scheme.  The following principles govern the leoFind class:

1. Find and Change commands initialize themselves using only the state of the
   present Leo window. In particular, the Find class must not save internal
   state information from one invocation to the next. This means that when the
   user changes the nodes, or selects new text in headline or body text, those
   changes will affect the next invocation of any Find or Change command.
   Failure to follow this principle caused all kinds of problems in the Borland
   and Macintosh codes. There is one exception to this rule: we must remember
   where interactive wrapped searches start. This principle simplifies the code
   because most ivars do not persist. However, each command must ensure that the
   Leo window is left in a state suitable for restarting the incremental
   (interactive) Find and Change commands. Details of initialization are
   discussed below.

2. The Find and Change commands must not change the state of the outline or body
   pane during execution. That would cause severe flashing and slow down the
   commands a great deal. In particular, c.selectVnode and c.editPosition
   methods must not be called while looking for matches.

3. When incremental Find or Change commands succeed they must leave the Leo
   window in the proper state to execute another incremental command. We restore
   the Leo window as it was on entry whenever an incremental search fails and
   after any Find All and Change All command.

Initialization involves setting the self.c, self.p, self.in_headline, self.wrapping and self.s_ctrl ivars. Setting self.in_headline is tricky; we must be sure to retain the state of the outline pane until initialization is complete. Initializing the Find All and Change All commands is much easier because such initialization does not depend on the state of the Leo window.

Using Tk.Text widgets for both headlines and body text results in a huge simplification of the code. Indeed, the searching code does not know whether it is searching headline or body text. The search code knows only that self.s_ctrl is a Tk.Text widget that contains the text to be searched or changed and the insert and sel Tk attributes of self.search_text indicate the range of text to be searched. Searching headline and body text simultaneously is complicated. The selectNextPosition() method handles the many details involved by setting self.s_ctrl and its insert and sel attributes.

<t tx="ekr.20060613062025.10">These commands put Leo into various kinds of modes.

- The ``enter-*-mode`` commands enter modes defined by @mode nodes in leoSettings.leo
  (or in other .leo files).
 
- The set-command-state, set-insert-state, set-overwrite-state commands
  determine how treats unbound plain keys. Leo ignores such keys in command
  state, inserts them into the body pane in insert state, and overwrites the
  character at the cursor position in overwrite state.
  
- Other commands determine whether autocompletion or calltips are in effect.

- When extend mode is effect, basic editing commands that move the cursor also
  extend the selected text.
  For example, in extend mode the ``back-char`` command works the same as the
  ``back-char-extend-selection`` command.
  
Here is the full list of mode-related commands::

    auto-complete
    auto-complete-force

What's New in Leo 4.4
##########################################

This page summarizes the changes made in Leo 4.4.
For full details see the release notes section in LeoDocs.leo.

The main features of Leo 4.4 are:

- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
  name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
  and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
  regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
  Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
  dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
  create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.
  To enable autocompletion, bind a key to the auto-complete command.

Leo 4.4.1 beta 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.1:
----------------------------
- A new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files.
  At present this plugin only reliably colors @language python code.
- Multiple editors in Leo's body pane.
- Search commands now support regex replace patterns: \1, \2, etc.
- Support for external debuggers: see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/debuggers.html
- The scripting plugin now creates a Debug Script button.
- Several new commands including run-unit-test, python-help and toggle-invisibles.
- The help-for-command commands now contains information for almost all commands.
- A new shortcut_button plugin.

<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.107">Leo now supports bindings of the form:

command-name !command = shortcut

You will find examples in leoSettings.leo in the node

@keys EKR bindings: vim mode bindings--&gt;Shortcuts--&gt;@shortcuts top-level keys

Such bindings are essential for all plain key bindings that are *only* to be executed in command mode.  Most, but *not* all plain key bindings should be bound in the !command 'pane'.  The two exceptions presently are '.' which *always* invokes the autocompleter code and '(' which *always* invokes the calltips code.

It is now possible to have a *single* set of key bindings be 'Emacs-like' and
'Vim-like' at the same time. See the node EKR bindings: vim mode bindings in
leoSettings.leo.

One setting switches between emacs-like operation and vim-like operation:

For emacs, use:
@strings  [ignore,insert,overwrite] top_level_unbound_key_action = insert

For vim, use:
@strings  [ignore,insert,overwrite] top_level_unbound_key_action = ignore

Vim-like modes are made possible by two new features:

1. Entry commands in @mode nodes. In the body of @mode nodes, lines of the form

--&gt; command-name

tell Leo to execute the command when entering the mode. More than one such lines
may exist; Leo executes them in the order they appear. Entry commands are
potentially a very powerful feature. To avoid chaos, entry commands should not
alter the minibuffer :-)

2. Silent modes. In order to keep the selected text visible, Leo must *not* move
focus into the minibuffer for editing commands. The set-silent-mode command
tells Leo to treat the mode described in the @mode node as a silent mode. A true
mode is created, but it only affects key bindings and the minibuffer never
becomes active.

Thus, all @mode nodes for vim-like modes contain the following line:

--&gt; set-silent-mode.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.108">All sets of key bindings in leoSettings.leo now start with @keys in the headline
of the root node. The @keys convention is used *only* by the Check Bindings
script. So now, instead of having a static list of key bindings sets (which is
guaranteed to get out-of-date), the Check Bindings script can scan all of
leoSettings.leo for sets of key bindings.

Another improvement to the Check Bindings script. Besides doing a better job of
checking, you may now specify optional commands, such as commands defined in
plugins. The Check Bindings will not complain if the commands don't presently
exists in k.commandsDict. You specify such commands by adding items to the
following lists in the root node of the Check Bindings script, i.e., the node
Buttons--&gt;@button Check Bindings.

optionalCommandPrefixes = ['group-operations']
optionalCommandNames = []</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.109">- added isearch-with-present-options.
- many small improvements to isearch code.
- regex searches now highlighted properly.
- isearches are (and should be) confined to a single body text.
- Backspace now handled properly.

A small glitch. Starting a regexp pattern with '.' will cause the entire pattern
to turn red initially, which is technically correct but perhaps a bit
confusing.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060620094645.234">@nocolor

The scripting plugin now creates a press-x-button command for each scripting button named x.
You can bind shortcuts to such commands by placing @shortcuts nodes in an @setting tree in the outline containing the @button nodes.  test.leo shows an example.

What I did:
    
- The scripting plugin now defines button bindings with the 'button' pane specifier.
  This takes precedence over all other specifiers.

- k.bindKeyToDict now does a better job of detecting and warning about redefinitions.

- k.printBindings now properly sorts entries.
  This was causing me a great deal of confusion.

- k.registerCommand now properly gets shortcuts from settings if possible,
  and makes bindings in the new 'button' pane specifier.

- masterKeyHandlerHelper now supports the 'button' pane specifier,
  which overrides all others.

In Doc_Only_Mode the rst3 plugin outputs headlines irrespective of the show_headlines
setting.  The other modes do honour thi setting.

I scratched around and managed to fix this by changing the node: rst3.py--&gt;class
rstClass--&gt;write methods--&gt;writeBody &amp; helpers--&gt;handleDocOnlyMode

In Line 25 I added a new statement:
     if showHeadlines:
and indented the following 3 lines to make them conditional on this if:
        if result or showThisHeadline or showOrganizers or p == self.topNode:
            # g.trace(len(result),p.headString())

I have a @url node pointing to a Leo file which has a filename with %20 in it.
When I double-click this node I get:

"can not open: \\\Documents%20and%20Settings\tftcj1.EDCON\My%20Documents\Proj\RI

Taking a look with a debugger, I see that Plugins--&gt;Enhancing the icon and status

I am looking at the image pluging for organising photos, and discovered that
it is limited to gif files only.  I found this a bit silly as installing the
ImageTk module from the Python Imaging Library and making a two line change
to the pluging enables it to be used on practically any image type.

The two line are:
1.  a new import:-
import ImageTk

2. In &lt;&lt;select image&gt;&gt; line 9 change 
photo = Tk.PhotoImage(master=a.root, file=filename)

to

photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(master=a.root, file=filename)</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060621075135">This section provides step-by-step instructions for turning a script button into a plugin.
The plugin will define a minibuffer command that does the same thing as pressing the button.

We shall start with a script button whose script is::
    
    g.es_print('c: %s' % (c.fileName()),color='red')
    g.es_print('p: %s' % (p.headString()),color='red')
    
Not very exciting, but it uses the predefined ``c`` and ``p`` constants.
Our plugin will create a minibuffer command called print-cp.

Here are the step-by-step instructions:
    
1. Open leoPlugins.leo and use the Copy Node command to copy the tree at:
    
Plugins--&gt; Templates: these show recommended ways of defining plugins.--&gt;Template for Tk plugin with per-commander controller class

2. Paste the tree somewhere else and rename it to @thin print_cp.py.
   I copied the tree to::
        
    Plugins--&gt;Example code--&gt;@thin print_cp.py

3. Update the docstring, the __version__ constant and the &lt;&lt; imports &gt;&gt; section.
   Note that unlike when using script buttons, you must have the following imports::
       
    import leoGlobals as g
    import leoPlugins
    
4. Because this plugin doesn't require any gui interface, we simplify the ``init`` function::
    
    def init ():
        leoPlugins.registerHandler('after-create-leo-frame',onCreate)
        return True

   The init function registers the onCreate hook and
   returns True to indicate that it loaded properly.
   
5. Leave the ``onCreate`` function unchanged.
   It creates a per-commander instance of the pluginController class.
   This class exists mainly to bind self.c properly to a commander.
   
6. Change the constructor (__init__ method) of the pluginController class to this::
    
    def __init__ (self,c):
        self.c = c
        c.k.registerCommand('print-cp',shortcut=None,func=self.print_cp)
        script = "c.k.simulateCommand('print-cp')"
        g.makeScriptButton(c,script=script,buttonText='Print c &amp; p',bg='red')
        
   This registers the print_cp *method* of the print_cp class as the print-cp minibuffer command,
   and creates a script button with the following script::
       
       c.k.simulateCommand('print-cp')
   
7. Define the print_cp method as follows::
    
    def print_cp (self,event=None):
        c = self.c ; p = c.currentPosition()
        g.es_print('c: %s' % (c.fileName()),color='red')
        g.es_print('p: %s' % (p.headString()),color='red')
        
   The print_cp method must have the event argument as shown because it implements a minibuffer command.
   The print_cp method gets the proper commander from the ``c`` ivar (instance variable) and computes
   the current position ``p`` as shown.
   
8. Enable the print_cp plugin using the plugins manager plugin,
   or just add the following line somewhere in pluginsManager.txt::
    
    print_cp.py

9. Test the plugin by restarting Leo (I just start test.leo).
   You can test the plugin by pressing the 'Print c&amp;p' button
   or by typing &lt;Alt-x&gt; print-cp &lt;Return&gt;.
   
That's all.  You can find the completed version of the print_cp plugin in leoPlugins.leo,
or leoPluginsRef.leo if you are using cvs.</t>

Leo 4.4.1 beta 3 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.1:
----------------------------
- A new colorizer plugin controlled by jEdit language description files.
  At present this plugin only reliably colors @language python code.
- Multiple editors in Leo's body pane.
- Search commands now support regex replace patterns: \1, \2, etc.
- Support for external debuggers: see http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/debuggers.html
- The scripting plugin now creates a Debug Script button.
- Several new commands including run-unit-test, python-help and toggle-invisibles.
- The help-for-command commands now contains information for almost all commands.
- A new shortcut_button plugin.

<t tx="ekr.20060629083935">Leo 4.4 was a year-long effort to incorporate an Emacs-style minibuffer and
related commands into Leo. Thinking in terms of minibuffer commands frees my
thinking. Leo 4.4 also featured many improvements in how keys are bound to
commands, including per-pane bindings and user-defined key-binding modes.

Development on long-delayed projects accelerated after 4.4 final went out the door.
Recent projects include:
    
- Controlling syntax coloring with jEdit's xml language-description files.
  See Chapter 15.
- Support for debugging scripts using external debuggers.
  See Chapter 16.
- Modifying Leo's vnodes and tnodes so that Leo's data can be used with ZODB.
  See Chapter 17.
- Using pymacs to write Leo scripts within Emacs.
  See Chapter 18.
- Using the leoBridge module to embed Leo support in other programs.
  See Chapter 19.
- Using Leo to run unit tests.
  See Chapter 20.</t>

1. Open leoSettings.leo.

2. Find the node 'Keyboard shortcuts'.

3. Disable the old bindings by moving the node
   '@keys EKR bindings: Emacs keys + modes'
   so that it is a child of the node:
   '@ignore Unused key bindings'.

4. Notice that there are two child nodes of the node
   '@ignore Unused key bindings'
   that refer to legacy key bindings:
    
   - '@keys Legacy Leo shortcuts with important Emacs bindings'

   - '@keys Legacy Leo bindings'.

5. Move **one** of these two legacy nodes up one level so that it is a child of the node
   'Keyboard shortcuts'.
   It should **not** be a child of the node
   '@ignore Unused key bindings'.</t>

There is no direct way to make script buttons available in multiple Leo files.
Sure, you could copy and paste the @button nodes, but there is a slightly
easier way using the "New Buttons" plugin.

1) Create and test and debug your desired Script Button.

2) With the Script Button node selected, run Plugins --&gt; New buttons --&gt; Make Template From

Open a new Leo file.

3) Assuming you have only the one New Button Template defined, left-click the
   New button, and a new node will be added to your outline. (Otherwise, you'll
   need to select the Template you want.)

4) Press [Script Button] to create the new script button.

It's easier to *do* this than to *explain* it!</t>

<t tx="ekr.20060823094954.1">The shadow plugin allows you to use Leo with files which contain no
Leo comments, and still have information flow in both directions:
from the file into Leo, and from Leo into the file.
 
To use this plugin:

1. Install the shadow script button found in leoPy.leo in the node::
    
    Code--&gt;Buttons and settings--&gt;@@button shadow
    
   That is, copy and paste this @button node to your Leo outline, and change @@button to @button.

2. Position the cursor somewhere in your tree.

3. Clicking the shadow button will create a shadow file for all @thin nodes
   in the selected outline.

After this initial setup, changes in Leo will be reflected both in the file
in the Leo subfolder, and the file without sentinels.
Conversely, changes in the file without sentinels will flow back to the file
in the leo subfolder, and show up in Leo.
Text insertions within a node will show up as expected. Text insertion
at the end of the node will show up and the end of the node.
Note that the plugin never structures input; this has to be done manually
within Leo.

You can set settings for this plugin in leoSettings.leo at::
    
     @settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;shadow plugin.

- @string shadow_subdir (default: LeoFolder): name of the shadow directory.

- @string shadow_prefix (default: x): prefix of shadow files.
  This prefix allows the shadow file and the original file to have different names.
  This is useful for name-based tools like py.test.</t>

OK, I found out how to duplicate this one.  This caused me a lot of grief until
I found out what is causing it.

NodeA:
...Child1
...Child2
...Child3

NodeB:
...CloneChild1
...CloneChild2
...CloneChild3

Now, put cursor on NodaA.  Ctrl-Shift-C (copy node).
Next, put cursor on CloneChild3.  Paste Node as Clone
You should get an invalid paste clone message.

Now, first cursor move (for me) puts NodeB as top node, ERASING all other nodes.
Warning:  DO NOT SAVE NOW.  It will erase all other nodes.

- Created getLeoOutlineHelper.  This simplifies the code.
- Init self.checking in getLeoFile and getLeoOutline.
- Use self.checking in getVnodes, getVnode and createVnode.
  Using self.checking in getVnode complicates an already way-too-complex method, but it can't be helped.</t>

A .leoID.txt with a \n behind the idstring creates a problem. 
It will be read in g.app.leoID and being used as is when writing the Leo file.

I have a tree of some 2500 nodes, run a script that marks
probably 1500-2000 of them, and that's quick (2-3 seconds max.).

I can clear all the marks with:

for p in c.allNodes_iter():
    p.v.clearMarked()

and that also is quick (2-3 seconds max.).  But when I use the menu option Unmark
All, that takes forever (1-2 minutes :-) running 100% CPU all the while.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060830142929">This section discusses only those settings that affect syntax coloring.
See `Chapter 8`_ for a general discussion of Leo's settings.

Both the old colorizer (in Leo's core) and the new colorizer (the threading_colorizer plugin)
now support @font settings for colorizing options.
The settings for the old colorizer are::

    comment_font, cweb_section_name_font, directive_font,
    doc_part_font, keyword_font, leo_keyword_font, section_name_font,
    section_name_brackets_font, string_font, undefined_section_name_font,
    latexBackground_font, and latex_background_font.

The settings for the new colorizer are all of the above (except keyword_font) plus the following::

    comment1, comment2_font, comment3_font, comment4_font, function_font,
    keyword1_font, keyword2_font, keyword3_font, keyword4_font, label_font,
    literal1_font, literal2_font, literal3_font, literal4_font, markup_font,
    null_font, and operator_font.
    
To specify a font, say for keyword_font, to be used as the default font for **all** languages,
put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # keyword_font_family = None
    keyword_font_size = 16
    keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold
        
Comments are allowed and undefined settings are set to reasonable defaults. 
At present, comments can not follow a setting: comments must start a line.

You can specify per-language settings by preceding the settings names by a prefix x.
Such settings affect only colorizing for language x (i.e., all the modes in modes/x.py when using the new colorizer).
For example, to specify a font for php (only), put the following in the body text of an @font node in leoSettings.leo::

    # php_keyword_font_family = None
    php_keyword_font_size = 16
    php_keyword_font_slant = roman
        # roman, italic
    php_keyword_font_weight = bold
        # normal, bold</t>

pathToZodbStorage is the full path to the zodb storage file.
You can call g.init_zodb as many times as you like.
Only the first call for any path actually does anything:
subsequent calls for a previously opened path simply return the same value as the first call.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913165542.3">This vnode method returns v2, a copy of v that is completely detached from the outline.
v2.t is a completely new tnode.
v2.fileIndex is None initially, but is may be convenient to copy this field::
    
    v2 = v.detach()
    v2.t.fileIndex = v.t.fileIndex</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170145">To enable zodb scripting within Leo, you must set ``use_zodb = True`` in the root node of leoNodes.py.
You must also install ZODB itself.  See `Installing ZODB`_ for details.

When ZODB is installed and ``use_zodb`` is ``True``
Leo's vnode and tnode classes become subclasses of ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
This is all that is needed to save/retrieve vnodes or tnodes to/from the ZODB.

**Important notes**:
    
- Scripts **should not** store or retrieve positions using the ZODB!
  Doing so makes sense neither from Leo's point of view nor from ZODB's point of view.

- The examples below show how to store or retrieve Leo data by accessing
  the so-called root of a ZODB connection.
  However, these are only examples.
  Scripts are free to do with Leo's vnodes and tnodes *anything* that can
  be done with ZODB.Persistence.Persistent objects.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403">Scripts should call g.init_zodb to open a ZODB.Storage file.
g.init_zodb returns an instance of ZODB.DB.  For example::
    
    db = g.init_zodb (zodbStorageFileName)

You can call g.init_zodb as many times as you like.
Only the first call for any path actually does anything:
subsequent calls for a previously opened path simply return the same value as the first call.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403.1">The following script writes v, a tree of vnodes, to zodb::

    db = g.init_zodb (zodbStorageFileName)
    connection = db.open()
    try:
        root = connection.root()
        root[aKey] = v # See next section for how to define aKey.
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()
    
Notes:

- v must be a vnode (or a tnode).
  Scripts should *not* attempt to store Leo positions in the zodb.
  v can be the root of an entire outline or a subtree.
  For example, either of the following would be reasonable::
  
    root[aKey] = c.rootPosition().v
    root[aKey] = c.currentPosition().v

- To write a single vnode without writing any of its children you can use v.detach.
  For example::
      
    root[aKey] = v.detach()
  
- **Important**: It is simplest if only one zodb connection is open at any one time,
  so scripts would typically close the zodb connection immediately after processing the data.
  The correct way to do this is in a finally statement, as shown above.
  
- The script above does not define aKey.
  The following section discusses how to define reasonable zodb keys.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913170403.2">The following script reads a tree of vnodes from zodb and sets p as the root position of the tree::

    try:
        connection = db.open()
        root = connection.root()
        v = root.get(aKey)
        p = leoNodes.position(v)
    finally:
        get_transaction().commit()
        connection.close()
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913175437">The keys used to store and retrieve data in connection.root() can be any string that uniquely identifies the data.
The following are only suggestions: you are free to use any string you like.

1. When saving a file, you would probably use a key that is similar to a real file path.
   For example::
       
        aKey = c.fileName()
   
2. When saving a single vnode or tree of vnodes, say v,
   a good choice would be to use v's gnx, namely::
    
        aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v.t.fileIndex)

   Note that v.detach() does not automatically copy v.t.fileIndex to the detached node,
   so when writing a detached node you would typically do the following::
       
       v2 = v.detach()
       v2.t.fileIndex = v.t.fileIndex
       aKey = g.app.nodeIndices.toString(v2.t.fileIndex)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060913175437.1">The scripts shown above close the zodb connection after processing the data.
This is by far the simplest strategy.
I recommend it for typical scripts.

**Important**: if must **leave the connection open** if your script modifies persistent data in any way.
(Actually, this statement is not really true,
but you must define zodb transaction managers if you intend to use multiple connections simultaneously.
This complication is beyond the scope of this documentation.)
For example, it would be possible to create a new Leo outline from the data just read,
but the script must leave the connection open.
I do not recommend this tactic, but for the adventurous here is some sample code::
    
    connection = self.db.open()
    root = connection.root()
    v = root.get(fileName)
    if v:
        c2 = c.new()
        c2.openDirectory = c.openDirectory # A hack.
        c2.mFileName = fileName # Another hack.
        c2.beginUpdate()
        try:
            c2.setRootVnode(v)
            c2Root = c2.rootPosition()
            c2.atFileCommands.readAll(c2Root)
            g.es_print('zodb read: %s' % (fileName))
        finally:
            c2.endUpdate()
        # Do *not* close the connection while the new Leo window is open!
    else:
        g.es_print('zodb read: not found: %s' % (fileName))
    
        
This will work **provided** that no other zodb connection is ever opened while this connection is opened.
Unless special zodb precautions are taken (like defining zodb transaction managers)
calling get_transaction().commit() will affect **all** open connections.
You have been warned.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060915112109">Find the @thin leoApp.py node in leoPy.leo.
In the ctor for the LeoApp class set ``self.use_psyco`` to True or False.
You will find this ctor in the node::
    
    Code--&gt;Core classes...--&gt;@thin leoApp.py--&gt;app.__init__
    
Note that this ivar can not be set using settings in leoSettings.leo because
Leo uses g.app.use_psyco before processing configuration settings.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060917130130">Add the following to the start of your scripts::
    
    @first # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Without this line, constructs such as::

    u = u'a-é-賢-z'
    u = 'a-é-賢-z'

will not work when executed with Leo's execute script command.
Indeed, the Execute Script command creates the script by writing the tree
containing the script to a string. This is done using Leo's write logic, and
this logic converts the unicode input to a utf-8 encoded string. So *all
non-ascii characters* (including both the é and 賢 characters) get converted to
their equivalent in the utf-8 encoding. Call these encoding &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt;. In
effect the script becomes::

    u = u'a-&lt;e1&gt;-&lt;e2&gt;-z'
    u = 'a-&lt;e2&gt;-&lt;e&gt;-z'

which is certainly *not* what the script writer intended!
Rather than defining strings using actual characters, Instead, one should use
the equivalent escape sequences. For example::

    u = u'a-\u0233-\u8ce2-z'
    u = 'a-\u0233-\u8ce2-z'

<t tx="ekr.20060920054924">.. _OPML:                   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML
.. _`OPML 2.0 standard`:    http://www.opml.org

**Warning**: the OPML plugin is not fully functional at present.  Use with caution.

The OPML plugin creates two new commands that read and write
Leo outlines in OPML_ format.
The read-opml-file command creates a Leo outline from an .opml file.
The write-opml-file command writes the present Leo outline to an .opml file.

Various settings control what gets written to .opml files, and in what format.
As usual, you specify settings for the OPML plugin using leoSettings.leo.
The settings for the OPML are found in the node::
    
    @settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;opml plugin
    
Here are the settings that control the format of .opml files.
The default values are shown.

- ``@bool opml_read_derived_files = True``

  If True, Leo reads derived files when reading .opml files.

- ``@string opml_namespace = leo:com:leo-opml-version-1``

  The namespace urn for the xmlns attribute of ``&lt;opml&gt;`` elements.
  This value typically is not used, but it should refer to Leo in some way.
    
- ``@bool opml_use_outline_elements = True``

  If True, Leo writes body text to ``&lt;:body&gt;`` elements nested in ``&lt;outline&gt;`` elements.
  Otherwise, Leo writes body text to ``:body`` attributes of ``&lt;outline&gt;`` elements.

  **Note**: Leo-specific attributes and elements are clearly distinguished from 'standard' opml elements:
  they are preceded by a colon, which marks them as members of the default namespace specified specified
  by this option.  Thus, all OPML text generated by this plugin should conform to the `OPML 2.0 standard`_.

- ``@string opml_version = 2.0``

  The opml version string written to the ``&lt;OPML&gt;`` element.
  Use ``2.0`` unless there is a specific reason to use ``1.0``.

- ``@bool opml_write_body_text = True``

  If True, Leo writes body text to the OPML file.
  
- ``@bool opml_write_derived_files = True``

  If True, Leo writes derived files when writing .opml files.

- ``@bool opml_write_leo_details = True``

  If True, Leo writes the native attributes of Leo's ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements
  as attributes of the opml ``&lt;outline&gt;`` elements.
  The native attributes of ``&lt;v&gt;`` elements are
  ``a``, ``descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes``, ``expanded``, ``marks``,
  ``t``, and ``tnodeList``.

- ``@bool opml_write_leo_globals_attributes = True``

  If True, Leo writes `body_outline_ratio`` and ``global_window_position``
  attributes to the ``&lt;head&gt;`` element of the .opml file.
  
- ``@bool opml_write_uAs = True``

  If True, Leo writes unknown attributes (uA's) in &lt;:uA&gt; sub-elements of &lt;outline&gt; elements.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060920145745">Three commands in the Cmds:Body Editors menu allow to create and destroy separate editors in the body pane.
The Add Body Editor (add-editor) command adds a new editor in the body pane.
The Delete Body Editor (delete-editor) command deletes the presently selected editor,
The Change Body Editor (cycle-editor-focus) command cycles focus between editors in the body text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060921064744.1">This section describe the format of derived files.
Leo's `sentinel lines`_ are comments, and this section describes those comments.

The format of derived files produced by Leo 4.0 and later meets the following goals:

- The minimum of sentinels needed to properly recreate the outline.

- A robust way of telling whether newlines belong to sentinels or not.
  Prior to Leo 4.0, deleting blank lines before and after sentinel lines
  could corrupt the outline structure of the derived file.
  
- A minimum of intrusion and ugliness.
  
**New in Leo 4.2**:
Files derived from ``@thin`` use gnx's in ``@+node`` and ``@-node`` sentinels.
Such gnx's permanently and uniquely identify nodes.
Gnx's have the form::

    id.yyyymmddhhmmss
    id.yyyymmddhhmmss.n

The second form is used if two gnx's would otherwise be identical.

- ``id`` is a string unique to a developer, e.g., a cvs id.

- ``yyyymmddhhmmss`` is the node's creation date.

- ``n`` is an integer.

Here are the sentinels used by Leo, in alphabetical order.
Unless otherwise noted, the documentation applies to all versions of Leo.
In the following discussion, ``gnx`` denotes a gnx as described above.

\@&lt;&lt;
    A sentinel of the form ``@&lt;&lt;section_name&gt;&gt;`` represents a section reference.
    
    If the reference does not end the line,
    the sentinel line ending the expansion is followed by the remainder of the reference line.
    This allows the Read code to recreate the reference line exactly.

\@@
    The ``@@`` sentinel represents any line starting with ``@`` in body text
    except ``@``*whitespace*, ``@doc`` and ``@others``.
    Examples::
    
      @@nocolor
      @@pagewidth 80
      @@tabwidth 4
      @@code
      
\@afterref **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks non-whitespace text appearing after a section references.
    
\@+all **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the start of text generated by the ``@all`` directive.
    
\@-all **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the end of text generated by the ``@all`` directive.
    
\@at and \@doc
    The ``@+doc`` and ``@-doc`` sentinels delimit doc parts within a node that starts with ``@doc``.
    These sentinels are nested within ``@body`` directives.
    Similarly, ``@+at`` and ``@-at`` sentinels delimit doc parts within a node that start with ``@`` *whitespace*.
    We use the following **trailing whitespace convention**
    to determine where putDocPart has inserted line breaks::
    
        A line in a doc part is followed by an inserted newline
        if and only if the newline if preceded by whitespace.
    
    To make this convention work,
    Leo's write code deletes the trailing whitespace of all lines that are followed by a "real" newline.
    
    **Leo 4.0 and later**:
    The ``@+doc`` and ``@+at`` sentinels now contain the whitespace that follows
    the corresponding ``@doc`` or ``@`` directives.

\@+body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the start of body text.
    
\@-body **(Leo 3.x only)**
    Marks the end of body text.
    
\@delims
    The ``@delims`` sentinel inserts ``@@delims`` sentinels into the derived file.
    The new delimiter strings continue in effect until the next ``@@delims`` sentinel
    *in the derived file* or until the end of the derived file.
    Adding, deleting or changing ``@@delim`` *sentinels* will destroy Leo's ability to read the derived file.
    Mistakes in using the ``@delims`` *directives* have no effect on Leo,
    though such mistakes will thoroughly mess up a derived file as far as compilers,
    HTML renderers, etc. are concerned. 

\@+leo
    Marks the start of any derived file.
    This sentinel has the form::
    
        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo&lt;closing_delim&gt;
    
    The read code uses single-line comments if ``&lt;closing_delim&gt;`` is empty.
    The write code generates single-line comments if possible.
    
    **New in Leo 4.0**: The ``@+leo`` sentinel contains other information following
    ``@leo``.  For example::
        
        &lt;opening_delim&gt;@leo-ver=4-thin&lt;closing_delim&gt;
    
\@-leo
    Marks the end of the Leo file.
    Nothing but whitespace should follow this directive.
    
\@+middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the start of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.
    Typically no such sentinels are needed: most sections are defined in a direct child of the referencing node.
    
\@-middle **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Marks the end of intermediate nodes between the node that
    references a section and the node that defines the section.

\@+node and \@-node
    Mark the start and end of a node.
    
    **Leo 4.2 and later**::
    ``@+node`` and ``@-node`` sentinels use gnx's as described above::
    
        @+node:gnx:&lt;headline&gt;
        @-node:gnx:&lt;headline&gt;
    
    Leo generates these sentinels only for nodes containing body text.
    Leo no longer generates other ``@+node`` sentinels to indicate outline structure.
    As a result, there is no longer any need for ``@+body`` sentinels.
        
    **Before Leo 4.2**::
    ``@+node`` and ``@-node`` sentinels used child indices, and status fields as described below::
    
      @+node:&lt;child_index&gt;:&lt;status_fields&gt;:&lt;headline&gt;
      @-node::&lt;child_index&gt;:&lt;status_fields&gt;:&lt;headline&gt;
    
    ``&lt;child_index&gt;`` is a number from 1 to n indicating the index of the node in the list of its parent's children.
    ``&lt;status_field&gt;`` is the cloneIndex field of the form: "C=nnn", where nnn is an immutable clone index.
    ``&lt;headline&gt;`` contains *headline* text, not reference text.
    
\@nl **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Adds a newline to the body text.
    
\@nonl **(Leo 4.0 and later)**
    Suppresses a newline from the body text.
    
\@others
    The ``@+others`` sentinel indicates the start of the expansion of an ``@+others`` directive,
    which continues until the matching ``@-others`` sentinel.
    ``@others`` sentinels are nested within ``@body`` sentinels;
    the expansion of the ``@others`` directive always occurs within the body text of some node.

\@verbatim
    ``@verbatim`` indicates that the next line of the derived file is not a sentinel.
    This escape convention allows body text to contain lines that would otherwise be considered sentinel lines.
    
\@@verbatimAfterRef
    ``@verbatimAfterRef`` is generated when a comment following a section reference would otherwise be treated as a sentinel.
    In Python code, an example would be::
    
      &lt;&lt; ref &gt;&gt; #+others
    
    This sentinel is required only when blank lines are suppressed between sentinel lines.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172040">Leo 4.4.2 beta 1                                  September 29, 2006

Leo 4.4.2 beta 1 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.2:
----------------------------
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
  Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
  i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
  See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
- The leoOPML plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

<t tx="ekr.20060928172457.4">- Added support for controlling Leo from Emacs_ with pymacs_.
  See `Chapter 18: Leo and Emacs`_ for full details.
- Added Minibuffer and Settings submenus of the Cmds menu.
- At long last Leo creates a proper help menu on the Mac.
- Added a new convention for menu tables. If the first item (a string
  representing the menu label) starts with '*' Leo will convert hyphens to
  spaces and upcase the label. This convention allows a single string to
  represent both the menu label and its associated minibuffer command. As part
  of this reorganization, all menu tables in Leo's core now use only strings.
  This is an essential precondition to supporting @menu nodes in
  leoSettings.leo.
- Leo's Help menu now contains the Open scripts.leo command.
- Leo uses ctypes to import Aspell when run from Python 2.5 or later.
  Leo no longer needs Python-specific versions of aspell.dll.
- Added support for x-windows middle-button paste.
  This only works when the paste is made in the pane containing the selected text.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Created three scripts (in test.leo) that help create unit tests for Leo's edit commands.
  Create Created runEditCommandTest for use by these scripts.
- Improved print-bindings command.
  The bindings are sorted by prefix: this is a big help in understanding bindings.
  For each prefix, first print items with only a single character after the prefix.
- Made writing .leo files faster.
  The new code almost exactly twice as fast as the old.
- Added p.archivedPosition.
  This is a key first step towards Leap 204.
- Integrated sax with read logic.
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Eliminated unnecessary redraws when moving the cursor in the outline pane.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

Further improved outline navigation:
    
- Generalized navigation in outline pane to ignore @file, @thin, etc prefixes.
- Made outline navigation cumulative.
  When keystrokes in the outline pane are typed 'close' together Leo first tries to look
  for prefix + ch, where ch is the character just typed and prefix is the previous match.
  The term 'close together' is specified by the setting @float outline_nav_extend_delay.
  The outline search revers to a single-character if the extended search
  fails, so in fact the delay is not too significant. In practice everything works
  well without me thinking at all about what is happening.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172457.5">- Improved the mod_scripting plugin. Every button created by the plugin creates
  a corresponding command. The command name is the 'cleaned' version of the
  button name. Likewise, the plugin also creates a delete-x-button command,
  where x is the command name as just discussed. So now you can delete script
  buttons without right-clicking.
- Made 'About Plugin' dialog scrollable.
- Fixed bugs in groupoperations, multifile, nodenavigator and shortcut_button plugins.
- The rst3 plugin now registers the rst3-process-tree command.
- The leoOPML.py plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow.py plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- The paste_as_headlines.py plugins creates multiple headlines at once.
- The word_count.py plugin.

Improved the mod_scripting plugin:

- Made showing the Run Script button optional.
- The Script Button button now creates the press-script-button-button command.
- A new utility method does a much better job of massaging button and command names.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172457.8">-----------------------

|prev| |leo| |next|</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.81">What I did:
    
- Removed c argument from t, v and p ctors.
- Removed c argument from most position methods.
    - In particular, p.link, p.unlink, v.link and v.unlink no longer update c.currentPosition()
    - Moved all position methods that still had a c argument to the Commands class.
- Removed p.allNodes_iter.
- Added c.findRootPosition and c.findRootVnode.
- c.rootPosition now returns c.findRootPosition(c.currentPosition())

As a result:
    
- The tnode, vnode and position classes are *completely* independent of Leo.
  In particular, no tnode, vnode or position method gets a c argument.
- The p.link, p.unlink, v.link and v.unlink are significantly simpler.
- The machinery for keeping the root position up-to-date is
  simple and confined to one place in the Commands class.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.167"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.172">It now prints the binding for the command.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.180">Rewrote moveWordHelper. It now avoids Tk and regexes.  *Much* simpler.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.195">@nocolor

My present thinking is that scripts should be able to store/retrieve persistent
objects to/from the zodb. That is, the zodb plugin is likely to be retired.

Leo's vnode and tnode classes now derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent if
leoNodes.use_zodb is True. It remains to be seen whether having use_zodb = True
will cause any serious problems.

See the posting below (Scripting using zodb) for latest details.

See the node 'zodb get/put buttons' in test.leo for examples of how scripts can access zodb easily.

Created g.init_zodb and v.detach.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928172525.197">&gt; Do you see zodb as persisting Leo files or Leo nodes?

Interesting question.  I now see the zodb plugin as a proof-of-concept for *user-defined* scripts.  The zodb plugin is probably going to go away.

Let us suppose that db is a ZODB.DB instance. (To see how to create such an instance, see the init_zodb method in the zodb plugin.  Perhaps I'll defines something like g.openZodb to make this easier.)  Then the statements:

connection = db.open()
root = connection.root()
root[aKey] = v
get_transaction().commit()
connection.close()

will write all of v's data (all vnodes and tnodes) to the zodb.  This is true whatever v is: it can be the root of an entire outline, or any suboutline.  If you want to write a single node, you would have to 'detach' that node from the outline.  You can do this by copying the node and then unlinking the node from its descendents. Perhaps I could add a convenience method to the vnode class to make this easier.

&gt;Do you see zodb work as providing enhanced access to nodes across multiple files?

Scripts could do so easily.  Happily, the distinction between 'long-lived' and 'short-lived' connections is not important for scripts: a script should hold a connection open only for as long as needed.  So it would be easy to write any number of vnode trees to the zodb.  Later, another script could access any of the data in the zodb by zodb key.  Like this:

connection = db.open()
root = connection.root()
v = root.get(aKey)
p = leoNodes.position(v,[])

After running this script, p is a position representing the root of the tree of 'imported' vnodes.  The script above does not 'connect' the imported trees to an outline, nor should it do so.  As I write this, I realize that the position ctor should make the second argument optional, so that leoNodes.position(v) would be equivalent to leoNodes.position(v,[]).

Each script should open at most connection at a time and be sure to close any zodb connection it creates.  The proper way to do this is in a finally statement, like this:

try:
....connection = db.open()
....root = connection.root()
....v = root.get(aKey)
....p = leoNodes.position(v,[])
....&lt;&lt; do something with the nodes in p's tree&gt;&gt;
finally:
....get_transaction().commit()
....connection.close()

In short, the recent changes to Leo's vnode and tnode classes give scripts the ability to save/retrieve Leo data to/from the zodb in any way a script wants, without any further support from Leo, or from me.

I shall spend an hour or two more with the zodb plugin, but it looks to me that the plugin has served its purpose.  Rather than trying to guess how people will want to use the zodb, it will be simpler and more general to have people write scripts that do exactly what they want.  In particular, such scripts can easily sidestep the problems with multiple open connections.

Edward

P.S. Please note that the scripts shown above could not have been written without all the recent work with the zodb plugin and the big code reorg.

P.P.S. A couple of unit tests involving the new v/t.__hash__ methods just failed, so it may be just a little bit longer before the code on cvs is truly zodb ready.  I'll also be working on example scripts and the convenience methods described above.

<t tx="ekr.20060928194633.1">The myLeoSettings.leo file is a way of ensuring that your customized settings are not altered when updating Leo from cvs or while installing a new version of Leo.  The myLeoSettings.leo acts much like Python's site-customize.py file.  The myLeoSettings.leo file will never be part of any Leo distribution, and it will never exist in Leo's cvs repository.  This solution is *much* better than tring to update leoSettings.leo with scripts.

Leo loads settings from myLeoSettings.leo *after* loading settings from leoSettings.leo files but *before* loading settings from the .leo file being opened.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928195040"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928195040.1">The following plugins are new in Leo 4.4.2 b2:
    
leo_to_rtf
leo_to_html
leoOPML  (At present, contained in leoOPML.leo instead of leoPlugins.leo)
paste_as_headlines
slideshow
word_count

The __saxRead__.py plugin is an **experimental** for use by EKR.
It will be folded into Leo's core in the near future.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200207.1">This plugin takes an outline stored in LEO and outputs it as a numbered list to
an RTF file. The RTF file can be loaded into Microsoft Word and formatted as a
proper outline.

If this plug-in loads properly, you should have an "Outline to Microsoft RTF"
option added to your File &gt; Export... menu in Leo.

Settings such as outputting just the headlines (vs. headlines &amp; body text) and whether
to include or ignore the contents of @file nodes are stored in the rtf_export.ini file
in your Leo\plugins folder.

The default export path is also stored in the INI file. By default, it's set to c:\ so
you may need to modify it depending on your system.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200207.2">This plugin takes an outline stored in LEO and converts it to html which is
then either saved in a file or shown in a browser.

The outline can be represented as a bullet list, a numbered list or using html
&lt;h?&gt; type headings. Optionally, the body text may be included in the output.

If desired, only the current node will be included in the output rather than
the entire outline.

An xhtml header may be included in the output, in which case the generated html
will be valid XHTML 1.0 Strict.

The plugin is fully scriptable as all its functionality is available through a
Leo_to_HTML object which can be imported and used in scripts.

Several commands and menu items are provided to give easy access to the plugins
various features and options may be set via leo_to_html.ini file and the plugins
properties dialog.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200207.3">This plugin reads and writes Leo outlines in .opml (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) format.

The OPML plugin creates two new commands that read and write Leo outlines in OPML format.
The read-opml-file command creates a Leo outline from an .opml file.
The write-opml-file command writes the present Leo outline to an .opml file.

Various settings control what gets written to .opml files, and in what format.
As usual, you specify settings for the OPML plugin using leoSettings.leo.
The settings for the OPML are found in the node: @settings--&gt;Plugins--&gt;opml plugin

Here are the settings that control the format of .opml files. The default values are shown.

- @string opml_namespace = leo:com:leo-opml-version-1

  The namespace urn for the xmlns attribute of &lt;opml&gt; elements.
  This value typically is not used, but it should refer to Leo in some way.

- @bool opml_use_outline_elements = True

  If True, Leo writes body text to &lt;:body&gt; elements nested in &lt;outline&gt; elements.
  Otherwise, Leo writes body text to :body attributes of &lt;outline&gt; elements.

- @string opml_version = 2.0

  The opml version string written to the &lt;OPML&gt; element.
  Use 2.0 unless there is a specific reason to use 1.0.

- @bool opml_write_body_text = True

  Leo writes body text to the OPML file only if this is True.

- @bool opml_write_leo_details = True

  If True, Leo writes the native attributes of Leo's &lt;v&gt; elements as attributes of
  the opml &lt;outline&gt; elements. The native attributes of &lt;v&gt; elements are a,
  descendentTnodeUnknownAttributes, expanded, marks, t, and tnodeList.

- @bool opml_write_leo_globals_attributes = True

  If True, Leo writes body_outline_ratio` and global_window_position attributes to
  the &lt;head&gt; element of the .opml file.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928200600">This plug-in takes any text is stored in the clipboard and creates new headlines
for each line of text. The paste routine checks to make sure the line of text is not
greater than 50 characters in length. If it is, the routine truncates the headline to
50 characters and pastes the entire line into the body text of that node.

If the plug-in is functioning properly, a "Paste as Headlines" option should appear in
the Edit menu directly under the existing Paste option.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928201227">This plugin displays a message box with information about the body text of the current node 
such as number of: characters, words, lines, and paragraphs. It adds a "Word Count..." option
to the bottom of the Edit menu that will activate the message box.

The Word Count... menu has a shortcut key of 'W'.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060928201227.1">This plugin supports slideshows in Leo outlines.

It defines four new commands:

- next-slide-show:  move to the start of the next slide show,
  or the first slide show if no slide show has been seen yet.
  
- prev-slide-show:  move to the start of the previous slide show,
  or the first slide show if no slide show has been seen yet.

- next-slide: move to the next slide of a present slide show.

- prev-slide: move to the previous slide of the present slide show.

Slides shows consist of a root @slideshow node with descendant @slide nodes.
@slide nodes may be organized via non-@slide nodes that do not appear in the slideshow.

All these commands ignore @ignore trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060929040750">Leo has many commands that select nodes in the outline. These commands can be
found in the Outline:Go To menu.

**New in Leo 4.4.2**: When focus is in the outline Pane, you can move to from
node to node by typing the first letter of a headline. For example, typing 'a'
will go to the next visible headline that starts with either 'a' or 'A',
wrapping around to the start of the outline if needed. Typing an uppercase 'A'
will go to the next headline that starts with 'a' or 'A', making the node
visible (expanding its ancestors) if the node was not visible.

When keystrokes (in the outline pane) are typed 'close' together in time Leo
first looks for prefix + ch, where ch is the character just typed and prefix is
the previous match. The term 'close together' is defined by the setting: 
 
@float outline_nav_extend_delay = 2.0 
 
The outline nav search reverts to a single-character search if the extended
search fails, so in fact the delay is not too significant. In practice
everything works well without thinking about what is happening. </t>
<t tx="ekr.20060929043325">Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20060929043325.1">Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952">Plugins and scripts can create new tabs in the log panel.
The following creates a tab named test or make it visible if it already exists::
 
    c.frame.log.selectTab('Test')
    
g.es, g.enl, g.ecnl, g.ecnls write to the log tab specified by the optional
tabName argument. The default for tabName is 'Log'. The put and putnl methods of
the tkinterLog class also take an optional tabName argument which defaults to
'Log'.

**New in Leo 4.4.4**: plugins and scripts may call the
c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a log tab containing a Tk.Canvas
widget. Here is an example script::
    
    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)
        w.configure(bg='yellow')
    log.selectTab(tag)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.1">The c.frame.log class contains the following 'official' ivars::

    g.es('tabName',c.frame.log.tabName)     # The name of the active tab.
    g.es('tabFrame',c.frame.log.tabFrame)   # The Tk.Frame containing all the other widgets of the tab.
    g.es('logCtrl',c.frame.log.logCtrl)     # Tk.Text widget containing the log text.

The following ivars provide access to the body pane::
     
    g.es('bodyFrame',c.frame.body.frame)    # The Tk.Frame widget containing the c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    
The following ivars provide access to the outline pane::
    
    g.es('canvas',c.frame.tree.canvas) # The Tk.Canvas on which Leo's outline is drawn.
    
Tkinter provides a way of determining the enclosing widget of any widget.
The body text is enclosed in a Pmw.PanedWidget to support multiple editors.
    
    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    parent = w.pack_info().get('in') 
    g.es('bodyCtrl.parent',parent) # The Tk.Frame containing the body text.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.2">The following line removes the initial text widget::
    
    c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack_forget()

To make the text widget visible again::

    c.frame.log.logCtrl.pack(side='top',expand=1,fill='both')

Plugins and scripts can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.
For example, the following replaces the default text widget with a red box::

    import Tkinter as Tk

    # Remove the old contents.
    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()
    
    # Replace with a red frame.
    f = c.frame.newLog = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')
    
And the following will restore the original pane::
    
    c.frame.newLog.pack_forget()
    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.3">Warning: you will find it hard to execute scripts after removing the body pane,
so you had best make the following two scripts into script buttons before
executing them :-)

Plugins and scripts can pack any other widgets into c.frame.log.tabFrame.
For example, the following replaces the default text widget with a red box::

    import Tkinter as Tk
    
    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()
    
    f = c.frame.newBody = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')
    
To restore::
    
    c.frame.newBody.pack_forget()
    w = c.frame.body.bodyCtrl
    w.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003204952.4">The following replaces the outline pane with a red frame::

    parent =  w.pack_info().get('in')
    w.pack_forget()
    
    f = c.frame.newTree = Tk.Frame(parent,background='red')
    f.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')
    
And this script restores the outline::

    c.frame.tree.canvas.pack(side='left',expand=1,fill='both')</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061003212136">The following is no substitute for a full discussion of programming the Tk.Text

To write a line to the end of the log::
    
    w = c.frame.log.logCtrl
    w.insert('end','This is a test\n')

Leo 4.4.2 beta 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.2:
----------------------------
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
  Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
  i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
  See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
- The leoOPML plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- Much faster navigation through the outline.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now optionally closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse, including new commands and options.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.
- A sax parser can now optionally read .leo files.
- Fixed numerous bugs.

Leo's theory of relativity

1. We can archive any position p by saving the list [p.childIndex() for p in
   p.self_and_parents_iter()]. Let us call the *reverse* of this list the
   **parents index list**. Clearly, this list provides an unambiguous way of
   reaching position p from the root node. Archived positions, like all other
   positions, become invalid when the outline changes. 
 
2. Leo's position class can be based on parents index lists. Let us call such
   positions **new positions**. Replacing legacy positions with new position
   will have important benefits: 
 
- The only structure information in vnodes will be a v.links field. Two
  interpretations of v.links are possible. When Leo's data is a DAG (the clone
  world), v.links is a lists of v's children. This is the legacy world we all
  know and love. When Leo's data is an arbitrary graph, v.links is simply the
  list of all vnodes to which v points, with *no* necessary restrictions on what
  nodes may be contained in v.links. 
 
- New positions provide a self contained way of traversing an arbitrary graphs
  **largely independently** of the data. This is Leo's theory of relativity. The
  notions of 'parent' and 'sibling' have meaning *only* in the context of a
  particular position. The v.links field appears to be the absolute minimum
  amount of structure information that vnodes must contain. v.links defines the
  children or linked-to nodes in a general graph. 
 
- Leo's data can be considered an unrooted tree: *any* node could be considered
  the root. New positions provide enough information to traverse an arbitrary
  graph starting at any node. 
 
- The fundamental p.moveToX methods should be significantly faster. All of Leo's
  iterators use p.moveToX methods. 
 
3. The changeover to new positions can be done easily. Initially, the api of the
   new position class will be identical to the api of the present position
   class. Later, the api for the new position class might be extended in an
   upward compatible manner. The api's for the vnode and tnode class will remain
   strictly unchanged. 
 
4. These changes imply no change to the separation of data into vnodes and
   tnodes. This separation is required to handle clones. Furthermore, the format
   of .leo files is a separate issue from the internal representation of Leo's
   data, as proved by the opml plugin. Thus, the transition to new positions
   will have *no* effect on file formats, and no effect of scripts. All scripts
   will continue to work *exactly* as they have before, *except* scripts, e.g.
   unit tests, that probe Leo's internals. 
 
Summary 
 
Leo's theory of relativity is this: the position class provides a 'frame of
reference' for traversing data. **Only in a particular frame of reference** do
the notions of 'parent' and 'siblings' have meaning. Leo's theory of relatively
is the ultimate expression of LeoUser's notion of a 'sea of nodes'. It provides
a solid context on which to base traversals of either outlines with clones
(DAG's) or general directed graphs. 
 
Leo's position class, far from being just a technical tool, is important
theoretically. The position class (old or new) provides the essential tool
needed to separate data from traversals of the data. The re-visioning of the
position and vnode classes brings that potential into reality.

anywhere. Similar remarks apply to calltips, which relies on autocompleter
state.

Leo 4.4.2 beta 3 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

The beta release fixed dozens of bugs and smoothed many rough edges.  There
are no known major bugs in Leo.  This will be the last beta release before
LEo 4.4.2 final.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.2:
----------------------------
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
  Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
  i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
  See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
- The leoOPML plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- Much faster navigation through the outline.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now optionally closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse, including new commands and options.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.
- A sax parser can now optionally read .leo files.
- Fixed numerous bugs.

<t tx="ekr.20061025070825.1">The leoPymacs module is intended to be called from Emacs using pymacs.  It contains the following top-level functions:
    
- get_app()

  Returns the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.
    
- dump(anyPythonObject)

  Returns str(repr(anyPythonObject)).
  
- get_g()

  Returns the leoGlobals module of the hidden app created by the leoPymacs.init function.
  
- get_script_result()

  Returns g.app.scriptResult, where g.app is the hidden app.
  
- init()
  Calls leo.run(pymacs=True) to create a hidden Leo application.
  Later calls to open can open hidden Leo outlines that can be accessed via runScript.
  
- open(fileName)

  Opens the .leo file given by fileName.
  fileName must be the full path to a .leo file.
  Returns the commander of the open Leo outline, or None if the outline could not be opened.
  
- run_script(c,script,p=None)

  Executes a script in the context of a commander ``c`` returned by the leoPymacs.open.
  c may be None, in which case a dummy commander is created in which to run the script.
  In the executed script, p is set to c.currentPosition() if no p argument is specified.
  Returns g.app.scriptResult, where g.app is the hidden app.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061025081359">Leo's leoPymacs module is a simple 'server' for the pymacs_ package.
Using pymacs and leoPymacs, elisp_ scripts in Emacs_ can open .leo files and execute *Python* scripts
as if they were executed inside Leo.
In particular, such scripts can use Leo's predefined c, g and p variables.
Thus, *Python* scripts running in Emacs can:
    
- Open any .leo file. 
- Access any part of the outline. 
- Change any part of the outline, including derived files, 
- Save .leo files.
- Execute *any* Leo script.

In short, you can now do from Emacs anything that you can do with Leo scripting inside Leo.

Here are step-by-step instructions for executing Python scripts in Emacs:
    
**Step 1. Install pymacs** 

   The pymacs installation instructions should be clear enough.
   A clarification is needed about two-way communication between Python and lisp scripts:
   in truth, Python scripts can call the Pymacs.lisp function *only* if the Python script
   was invoked from emacs.
   Otherwise, calling Pymacs.lisp will hang the process making the call.
   For example, executing the following script as an ordinary Leo script will hang Leo::
   
        from Pymacs import lisp
        print lisp("""2+2""") # Hangs
        
**Step 2. Load the leoPymacs module from Emacs, creating a hidden Leo application**

  From inside Emacs, you load Leo's leoPymacs module as follows::

    (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-")
   
  The call to pymacs-load is similar to ``'import leoPymacs as leo-'`` in Python.
  The side effect of pymacs-load is to define the elisp function leo-x for every top-level function x in leoPymacs.py,
  namely leo-dump, leo-get-app, leo-get-g, leo-get-script-result, leo-init, leo-open and leo-run-script.
  The first call to any of these functions creates a **hidden Leo application**
  in which .leo files may be loaded, modified and saved,
  and in which Leo scripts may be executed.
  This hidden Leo application uses Leo's nullGui class as its gui,
  so Leo commands and Leo scripts that require a fully functional gui will not work as
  expected in the hidden Leo application.
  Steps 3 and 4 tell how to use this hidden Leo application.
  
  pymacs-load works like a Python reload, so you can redefine leoPymacs.py while Emacs is running.
  However, calling pymacs-load destroys the old hidden Leo application and creates a new one,
  so typically you would want to call pymacs-load only once per Emacs session.
  Like this::

        (setq reload nil) ; change nil to t to force a reload.

        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))
            (message "leoPymacs already loaded")
        )
   
**Step 3. From Emacs, open .leo files**

   Once we have loaded the leoPymacs module
   we can open a .leo file as follows::

    (setq c (leo-open fileName))
    
   This binds the elisp ``c`` variable to the Leo commander created by opening fileName.
   fileName should be the full path to a .leo file.
   In the next step we will use this ``c`` variable to execute *Leo* scripts in the
   context of an open Leo outline.
   
   Sometimes we want to execute a Leo script before opening any Leo commanders.
   For example, we might want to compute the fileName passed to leo-open.
   leo-run-script allows the ``c`` argument to be nil,
   in which case leo-run-script creates a dummy commander in which to run the script.
   For example, the following script calls ``g.os_path_join`` and ``g.os_path_abspath``::

        (setq script "g.app.scriptResult =
            g.os_path_abspath(g.os_path_join(
                g.app.loadDir,'..','test','ut.leo'))"
        )

        (setq fileName (leo-run-script nil script))
        
   leo-run-script returns the value of ``g.app.scriptResult``
   As shown above, Python scripts may set ``g.app.scriptResult`` to indicate their result.
   elisp scripts can also get ``g.app.scriptResult`` using leo-script-result.
   Note that the Python script may span multiple lines.

**Step 4. From Emacs, execute Leo (Python) scripts**

   From emacs we can execute a Python script **as if** it were executed in an
   open Leo outline.
   Suppose aLeoScript is an **elisp** string containing a Leo (Python) script.
   We can execute that script in the hidden Leo application as follows::

        (leo-run-script c aLeoScript)
    
   For example::

        (setq c (leo-open fileName)
        (csetq script "print 'c',c,'h',c.currentPosition().headString()")
        (leo-run-script c script)
    
Putting this all together, we get::
    
        ; Step 1: load leoPymacs if it has not already been loaded.
        (setq reload nil)
        (if (or reload (not (boundp 'leoPymacs)))
            (setq leoPymacs (pymacs-load "leoPymacs" "leo-"))

<t tx="ekr.20061025142434">Leo's mini-buffer is a text area at the bottom of the body pane.
You use Leo's minibuffer like the Emacs mini-buffer to invoke commands by their so-called *long name*.
The following commands affect the minibuffer:

- **full-command**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Puts the focus in the minibuffer. Type a
  full command name, then hit &lt;Return&gt; to execute the command. Tab completion
  works, but not yet for file names.

- **quick-command-mode**: (default shortcut: Alt-x) Like Emacs Control-C. This mode is
  defined in leoSettings.leo. It is useful for commonly-used commands.

- **universal-argument**: (default shortcut: Alt-u) Like Emacs Ctrl-u. Adds a repeat
  count for later command. Ctrl-u 999 a adds 999 a's.

- **keyboard-quit**: (default shortcut: Ctrl-g) Exits any minibuffer mode and puts
  the focus in the body pane.

For example, to print a list of all commands type Alt-X print-commands &lt;Return&gt;.</t>

Leo 4.4.2.1 final is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo 4.4.2.1 final fixes a recent bug that caused Leo not to create the
.leoRecentFiles.txt file properly in some situations. There are no known
significant bugs in this version of Leo.

Leo 4.4.2 final fixes a few bugs and adds support for pymacs. 

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.2:
----------------------------
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes are now completely independent of the rest of Leo.
  Some api's have been changed.  This 'big reorg' and may affect scripts and plugins.
- Leo's vnode and tnode classes can optionally be compatible with ZODB databases,
  i.e., they can optionally derive from ZODB.Persistence.Persistent.
  See Chapter 17: Using ZODB with Leo for details.
- The leoOPML plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- Much faster navigation through the outline.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now optionally closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse, including new commands and options.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.
- A sax parser can now optionally read .leo files.
- Fixed numerous bugs.

<t tx="ekr.20061129170155.2">CC2 allocated objects one-at-a-time (simple allocation), in blocks of
fixed-sized objects (block allocation) or in blocks of variable-sized objects
(lifetime-based allocation). Simple-allocation was used for short-lived objects
and will not be discussed further. Block allocation was used in several ways, the
most interesting of which was to allocate "cons cells" used to represent lists.
These cons cells could be reused by placing them on a global avail list. Thus,
the blocks holding cons cells could (and did) have permanent lifetime: they were
never deallocated.

The most interesting aspect of CC2's storage allocation scheme was what I
eventually came to call **lifetime-based** storage allocation. This was, for me,
an new discovery, though clearly I was not the first to discover it. The Aha is
that a lifetime is defined by the time (or equivalently by the place in program
code) at which objects are **deallocated**. A lifetime may hold many different
kinds of objects that were allocated at many different times. The essence of
lifetime-based allocation is that **the proper time to specify when an object
will be deallocated is when the object is created**.

Lifetime-based allocation is a superb invention:
    
- It becomes an effective design tool. Thinking of objects in terms of their
  lifetimes often shows the essence of a design problem.
  
- It can be used for any kind of object, regardless of its size or type.
    
- It reduces the number of calls to calloc and free by one or two orders of
  magnitude over naive schemes. Furthermore, it typically requests
  standard-sized blocks (say 8K or more) from calloc, further easing the burden
  on calloc and free.
  
- CC2 could allocate objects with a particular lifetime using small, extremely fast, macros.
  The macros expanded to C code something like this::

    if lifetime -&gt; avail &gt;= sizeof(theObjectKind) {
        // Allocate the storage.
        theObject = lifetime -&gt; ptr 
        lifetime -&gt; ptr += sizeof(theObjectKind)
    }
    else {
        &lt;&lt; allocate theObject in another block &gt;&gt;
    }

Importantly, the speed of the else clause makes absolutely no difference because
it is so seldom executed. Thus, it uses a function call. Clearly then, this code
is optimal: it could not be improved even if coded in assembly language.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061129170454">This white paper describes the storage allocation used in a commercial
optimizing C compiler written for Tuple, Inc. ca. 1993. The last section
discusses tantalizing possibilities for the pypy project. These possibilities
are why I wrote this paper.

Storage allocation is crucial to any compiler because of the number, size and
complexity of data which must be allocated. You might event say that a compiler
consists of storage allocation and everything else. I paid a lot of attention to
storage allocation in CC2, and that work paid off. The resulting compiler was a
few percent faster than the CodeWarrior C compiler, perhaps the fastest C
compiler in existence at that time. The original notes were written around 1993,
so I would do some things differently today. However, the design discussed below
still seems relevant today. Indeed, attention to low-level details can make a
huge difference.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061129175952">What makes lifetime-based allocation so powerful is that so few lifetimes are
typically required. Indeed, CC2 had only the following lifetimes:
    
- Permanent: These objects were never deallocated. Examples were list pointers
  held in cons cells and other kinds of application-wide objects.
  
- Tokenizer: Tokenizing in C is complex due to C's various preprocessing
  directives and macro expansion. Objects with tokenizer lifetime are
  deallocated before the parser starts.

- Function: Objects with function lifetime are deallocated after the compiler
  generates code for the function.

- File: Objects with file lifetime are deallocated after the compiler completes
  a source file.

That's all. Similarly, if Leo were recast as a C program only the following
lifetimes would be needed:
    
- Permanent: application-wide objects.

- Window/outline: All data associated with a single Leo outline. This is a
  'semi-permanent' lifetime. Leo has unlimited undo, so it is essentially
  impossible to delete any data object (an object that could be written to an
  output file) until the entire outline closes.

- Dialog: data associated with a temporary dialog.

- Function/method: data not used outside a single function or method.

The remarkable thing about dynamic languages like Python is how often objects
can, in fact, be assigned static lifetimes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20061129202238">Lifetime allocation isn't used in Java, Python, etc. because these languages
have no way of knowing (in general) what the lifetime of any object will be.
Furthermore, translating Python to C would be straightforward were it not for
storage allocation issues. For example, most of Leo's code could easily be
translated into C, **provided** that the lifetime of all objects were known.
Again, just for example, the prospect of translating the Python version of Leo
to a fully optimized C version is tantalizing.

This is where pypy comes in: its extensive flow analysis may be sufficient to
discover lifetimes for a significant percentage of objects. Perhaps user hints
may be effective. For example, pypy offers the chance to make something like
`region inference`_ truly useful. Note that the pypy project might benefit from
deducing lifetimes even if not all objects could be assigned a static
lifetime. Another reason why lifetimes are not a standard technique is that they
are a potentially dangerous optimization. Errors in specifying lifetimes will
result in dangling pointer references. But this danger might disappear if pypy
could deduce lifetimes automatically.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724">The following three section discuss three ways of debugging scripts with winpdb_.
The first two sections tell how to debug general scripts;
the last section tells how to debug Leo-specific scripts.

winpdb_ and its documentation have been improved recently.
For more details, see the `embedded winpdb`_ docs.
The discussion of embedded debugging may have been written specifically with Leo in mind.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.1">This way of debugging can only be used for general scripts, not leo-specific scripts.  
The debug command writes the script to scriptFile.py and invokes winpdb.
winpdb opens and is already 'attached' to the script to be debugged.
You can single-step as you like.
Leo continues to run, but killing the debugger will also kill Leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.2">``test.leo`` contains an ``@button windpdb`` node.
Select the test to be debugged, then press the winpdb button or do ``&lt;Alt&gt;x winpdb&lt;return&gt;``.
This way is essentially the same as using the debug command, though the code is slightly different.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070115172724.3">This way of debugging scripts allows winpdb to debug scripts that use c, g and p.
A bit more work is needed because winpdb does not start automatically.
Here are step-by step instructions:

1. Insert the following two lines of code at the start of the script to be debugged::

    import rpdb2
    rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger('go',fAllowUnencrypted=True)

2. Execute Leo's execute-script command (*not* the debug command).
   Leo will appear to hang: start_embedded_debugger is waiting for *another* copy of winpdb to 'attach' to the script's process.
   The default timeout is 5 minutes, after which an exception gets thrown.

3. Start winpdb explicitly by executing something like the following in a console::

    python /python25/Scripts/_winpdb.py -t

   The -t option tells winpdb that no encoding of password is necessary.
   The password is specified in the call to rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger in your script.
   In our example, the password is 'go'.

4. Use winpdb's ``File:Attach`` command to attach winpdb to Leo.
   Specify the password as 'go' and you will see the scriptFile.py containing your entire script.
   You can now execute or single-step through the script. 
   To repeat, c, g and p are defined, so you can debug any script this way.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070116062405">Inserting g.trace statements in my Pyhthon code is usually my first debugging
choice. The g.trace statement prints the name of the function in which the call
to g.trace occurs, followed by the value of its arguments. The output of the
g.trace goes to the console, so you must be `running Leo in a console`_ to use
g.trace.

Inserting and deleting g.trace statements is fast, provided that your `work
flow`_ makes it easy to restart the program under test. As a result, using
g.trace statements is similar to setting tracepoints in a debugger, with the
advantage that (disabled) tracepoints remain in the source code for future use.
You will find many examples of using g.trace throughout Leo's source code.

My second choice is using g.pdb to set breakpoints for the pdb_ debugger. Pdb
uses the console for all interaction, so you must be `running Leo in a
console`_. See `the FAQ`_ for a discussion of both g.trace and g.pdb.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070119131801">**Joined nodes** represent the same data. Joined nodes are vnodes v1 and v2 such
that v1.t == v2.t. Joined vnodes are distinct (v1 != v2) if the vnodes are
clones of each other. Joined nodes are in fact the same node (v1 == v2) if they
are descendants of clone nodes. In particular, we can say that p1.v is joined to
p2.v if p1.v.t == p2.v.t regardless of whether p1.v == p2.v. Thus a script can
process nodes exactly once if it ignores nodes joined to previously visited
nodes. A later section will provide an example of this common scripting pattern.

The following script illustrates a common idiom. It prints each headline of an
outline, eliminating duplications that would happen as the result of cloned
trees::
    
    d = {}
    for p in c.allNodes_iter():
        if p.v.t not in d:
            print p.headString()
            d[p.v.t] = p.v.t
            
As mentioned in the introduction, joined nodes share the same tnode. Thus, when
we visit a position p we print p.headString() only if p.v.t is not already in
the dictionary. We then enter p.v.t in the dictionary to prevent printing the
headlines of any future node joined to p.v.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070120075236">Leo's ``Execute Script`` command predefines ``c`` to be the commander of the
outline containing the script. ``g`` and ``p`` are predefined as follows::

    import leoGlobals as g
    p = c.currentPosition()
    
These definitions provide an easy way to access or change any
information in a Leo outline. For example, as discussed below, the following
script will print every headline in the Leo outline in which the script occurs.
    
    for z in c.allNodes_iter():
        print z.headString()

<t tx="ekr.20070122070634.223">New settings

The following two new settings now control whether the execute-script and debug commands write the script to an external file.

- @bool write_script_file = True

True: The execute script command writes the script to be executed to a file, then executes the script using Python's execFile function. The script_file_path setting specifies the path to this file.
    
False (legacy): The execute script command uses Python's exec command to execute the script. 

- @string script_file_path = ../test/scriptFile.py

The path to the file to be written by the execute-script command.

Notes:
    
- This setting has effect only if the write_script_file setting is True.
- Use / to as the path delimiter, regardless of platform.
- The default path is ../test/scriptFile.py if no path is given.
- The path starts at g.app.loadDir, so for example ../test/scriptFile.py is equivalent to leo/test/scriptFile.py
- The filename should end in .py.

From here on, let us assume the settings are as shown above.  There are at least three ways of debugging scripts, depending on your preferences and whether the script contains leo-specific code (g, c or p) or not.

First way:  The debug command

The debug command now works almost exactly like Kent's original @button node. This way of debugging can only be used for general scripts, not leo-specific scripts.  

The debug command writes the script to scriptFile.py and invokes the debugger as specified by the existing @string debugger_kind option.  winpdb opens and is already 'attached' to the script to be debugged.  You can single-step as you like.  Leo continues to run, but killing the debugger will also kill Leo.  When started this way, winpdb is really 'attached' to *all* of Leo, which means you can single step past the end of the script into Leo's executeScript code and from there into all of Leo(!)

As I write this I realize that the code uses arguments specific to winpdb.  That may have to be generalized, though I am not sure why anyone would want to use another debugger...

Second way: @button winpdb

This is almost exactly equivalent to the debug command, except that the script file must be *different* from the script file specified by the  script_file_path setting (The @button code *itself* uses the execute-script command, so we have to pass the script code, not the @button code to the debugger).

Third way: The execute-script command with explicit debugger breaks

The third way of debugging scripts allows winpdb to debug scripts that use c, g and p.  I'm actually not sure of exactly how and why it works, but it certainly does work.

In contrast to the previous two ways, a little more work is needed because winpdb does not start automatically.  But I am getting ahead of myself.

To use this way, insert the following two lines of code at the start of the script to be debugged::

import rpdb2
rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger('go',fAllowUnencrypted=True)

Now just execute the execute-script command (*not* the debug command)  Leo will appear to hang.  Indeed, the  start_embedded_debugger command is waiting for *another* copy of winpdb to 'attach' to the script's process.  This process is all of Leo!  The default timeout is 5 minutes: I'm not sure what happens when the timeout happens: probably an exception gets thrown.

So you must start winpdb explicitly.  On XP just do something like

python c:\python25\Scripts\_winpdb.py -t

The -t option tells winpdb that no encoding of password is necessary.  The password is specified in the call to rpdb2.start_embedded_debugger in your script.  In this example, the password is 'go'.  Use the File:Attach command in winpdb to attach winpdb to Leo.  Specify the password as 'go' and you will see the scriptFile.py containing your entire script.  You can execute or single-step through the script. 

To repeat, the big difference is that c, g and p are defined, so you can debug any script this way.  As before, killing winpdb also kills Leo.

P.S.  winpdb and its documentation has been improved recently.  See

http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/  and especially

http://www.digitalpeers.com/pythondebugger/embedded.htm

The discussion of embedded debugging may have been written specifically with Leo in mind.  It certainly could have been.

finger can hit a key in the lower left corner of the keyboard, and I don't have
to worry too much about my aim (I have LARGE fingers). Also, I stop the
scrolling on the JUST button release -- less worry about my finger slipping off
the key.</t>

When a node is among several other nodes at the same level of hierarchy, which
are all children of a node, and the "MOVE LFET" command is executed, the node
does move left in the outline hierarchy, but it also move down to just before
the next node at the higher hierarchy level - the level to which it is moving
left.

EKR: I love this new option: how did we ever live without it?

This option tells how to treat an uppercase letter typed when the outline pane
is active but no headline is being edited. In such situations Leo searchs for an
node whose headline starts with the present prefix, ignoring case The prefix
starts with the first letter typed and other letters are added if they are typed
within a 'short' period of time, as specified by the outline_nav_extend_delay

True: Look in invisible nodes.
False: Look only in visible nodes.

I set this option to False because it is too easy form me to type Shift-whatever
when I meant Ctrl-whatever.

Leo 4.4.3 alpha 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

This version of Leo should be safe enough for production use. It is an alpha
distribution because not all plugins have been tested on the reorganized code
base.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.3:
----------------------------
- A leoBridge module that allows full access to all of Leo's capabilities
  from programs running outside of Leo.
- Added support for @enabled-plugins nodes in settings files.
- The__wx_gui plugin is now functional.
- Removed all gui-dependent code from Leo's core.
- Better support for the winpdb debugger.
- Many minor improvements, new settings and bug fixes.

I'm generating Leo files with ElementTree and ran into a minor issue.

ElementTree generates an empty tag with a space before the closing slash:
    
&lt;globals /&gt;

in Leo's code for dummy elements to allow copied nodes to be valid Leo files,
the empty tags are generated without the space

leoFileCommands.py 2917
        self.put('&lt;globals/&gt;\n')
        self.put('&lt;preferences/&gt;\n')
        self.put('&lt;find_panel_settings/&gt;\n')
        
it then checks for these tags in getDummyElements() leoFileCommands.py 1298

Since ElementTree has the space before the slash, 
it's XML is considered invalid by Leo according to
this test.

I would like it if the space could be added in Leo's
self.put(...) and the check in getDummyElements()

The XML specs show the space as optional.

Host programs use the leoBridge module as follows::

copy of Leo uses a 'null' gui, which simulates all aspects of Leo's normal gui
code without creating any screen objects.

The statement::

=================== =====================================================================

The actual settings are specified in the body text.  At present, there are seven kinds of complex settings nodes:
    
- ``@buttons``

  **New in Leo 4.4.4**: All @buttons tree in a settings file defines global buttons that
  are created in the icon area of all .leo files.
  You define @button nodes in the @buttons tree as usual.
  
- ``@data``

  **New in Leo 4.4.5**: The body text contains a list of strings, one per line.
  Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
    
- ``@enabled-plugins``

  **New in Leo 4.4.3**: The body text of the @enabled plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins.
  This body text is treated exactly as the contents of the pluginsManager.txt file.
  Notes:

    A) Leo attempts to load all plugins every time an @enabled-plugins node is seen.
       If the plugin has already been loaded, Leo silently ignores the
       request to re-enable the plugin.
       Leo never attempts to disable a plugin while processing enabled plugin
       strings. Thus, plugins enabled in an @enabled-plugins node in leoSettings.leo
       *will* be enabled regardless of the contents of any other @enabled-plugins node.
    
    B) Leo will read the pluginsManager.txt file only if no @enabled-plugins node is
       found. The pluginsManager.txt file will no longer be part of the Leo
       distribution. Instead, the default plugins will be enabled in an @enabled-plugins
       node in leoSettings.leo.
       
    C) g.app.gui.getEnabledPlugins contains the last value last processed @enabled-plugins node, or the
       contents of the first pluginsManager.txt file encountered.

- ``@font``

  The body text contains a list of settings for a font.  For example::

    body_text_font_family = Courier New
    body_text_font_size = None
    body_text_font_slant = None
    body_text_font_weight = None

  **Important**: you can use the show-fonts minibuffer command to guide you in making these settings.
  
- ``@menus``

  **New in Leo 4.4.4**: Leo creates its menus from the @menu and @item nodes in the @menus tree.
  Within @menus trees, @menu nodes create menus and @item nodes create menu items. 
 
  The menu name always follows @menu. If the menu name is 'Plugins', Leo will
  create the Plugins menu and populate the menu by calling the
  'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual. Nested
  @menu nodes define submenus.
 
  The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this
  body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name.
  However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the
  menu name. Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If
  present, the following character is underlined in the name. If the command
  name in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents a menu
  separator.

- ``@mode`` *&lt;mode name&gt;*

  The body text contains a list of shortcut specifiers.
  ``@mode`` nodes work just like ``@shortcuts`` nodes,
  but in addition they have the side effect of creating the ``enter-&lt;mode name&gt;-mode`` command.

- ``@recentfiles``

  The body text contains a list of paths of recently opened files, one path per line.
  Leo writes the list of recent files to ``.leoRecentFiles.txt`` in Leo's ``config`` directory,
  again one file per line.

- ``@shortcuts``

  The body text contains a list of shortcut specifiers.</t>

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.3:
----------------------------
- Added support for chapters in Leo's core.
  Chapters are disabled by default.  To enable, set @bool use_chapters = True.
- Added support for zipped .leo files.
- Added a leoBridge module that allows full access to all of Leo's capabilities
  from programs running outside of Leo.
- Removed all gui-dependent code from Leo's core.
- Better support for the winpdb debugger.

Would it be possible to have the table of "Open With" editors to be part of
the config system? I find myself patching the list every time I D/L a new Leo
version to add the editor I use. This would also help isolate the user from
the "guts" of Leo, theereby being less intimidating.

<t tx="ekr.20070513111526.39"></t>
<t tx="ekr.20070513111526.42">Leo now supports zipped .leo files:

- Leo now has save-file-as-zipped and save-file-as-unzipped commands, and
corresponding Save File As Zipped and Save File as Unzipped items in the File
menu. These are exactly the same as Leo's Save As commands except that they
temporarily force Leo to write the file in either zipped or unzipped format.

- Leo remembers whether a file was originally zipped. The read logic handles
either zipped or unzipped .leo files automatically. The write logic will zip the
file if it was originally zipped or if the save-file-as-zipped command is being
executed.

- Leo writes files with .leo extension, regardless of whether the file is zipped
or not. Zipped .leo files contain a single archive, whose name is the same as
the .leo file itself.

Notes:

- The new save commands suffice to compress and expand .leo files on a
file-by-file basis. In particular, there is no need for any user settings.

- Outside of Leo you can change the extension to .leo.zip and use stuffit or
other program to expand the .leo file contained within. I've only tested this on
XP, but it should work everywhere...

- At present the code uses Python's zipfile module to read and write zipped files.
In turn, the zipfile module uses the zlib module to do the compression.
Conceivably somebody might want Leo to use some other compression technique, say
Python's tarfile module. However, I think the present way should suffice for
most people.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20070513115832.2">- @test and @suite nodes may now be embedded in derived files.
- Added support for chapters to Leo's core

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.
  
  Selecting a chapter shows the nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter

    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:
      
  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.
  
- Added support for compressed .leo files

  Leo now has save-file-as-zipped and save-file-as-unzipped commands, and
  corresponding Save File As Zipped and Save File as Unzipped items in the File
  menu. These are exactly the same as Leo's Save As commands except that they
  temporarily force Leo to write the file in either zipped or unzipped format.
  Leo remembers whether a file was originally zipped. The read logic handles
  either zipped or unzipped .leo files automatically. The write logic will zip
  the file if it was originally zipped or if the save-file-as-zipped command is

The fix was to give the canvas, not the headline focus when clicking on a headline.
This results in canvas bindings, not text bindings, having priority.
This is not a kludge: the text widget isn't active, so text bindings should not be in effect.

<t tx="ekr.20070622141457">Leo is distributed either as an executable installer (.exe) file or as a .zip file.

To install Leo using the executable installer:
    
    1. Download the latest version of Leo's installer from `Leo's download page`_.
       The installer will be called something like LeoSetup-4-4-3.exe.
       
    2. Run the installer.
       By default, the install will install Leo in your 'Program Files' directory.

To install Leo from the .zip file:
    
    1. Download the latest version of Leo (a .zip file) from `Leo's download page`_.  

    2. Unzip the .zip file and place the unpacked leo folder in 
       the 'Program Files' folder or any convenient location.
       
After you have installed Leo, you should add the location of your leo/src folder to your python path.
One way to do this is adding something like the following to python/Lib/sitecustomize.py::
      
    import sys
    sys.path.append(r'&lt;path-to-leo&gt;leo\src')
            
Another way is to append &lt;path-to-leo&gt; to the Windows PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Now that you have installed Leo and told Python where to find Leo,
you are ready to `run Leo`_.

**Note**:
If you haven't already created a HOME environment variable, it would be good to
define home to be "%USERPROFILE%\My Documents".  You can check whether HOME exists
by typing 'echo %HOME%' (without the quotes) in a console window.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070622141457.1">By Randall Voth:
Leo works reliably only on MacOS X 10.3 (Panther) and above.
To run Leo on Macintosh OS X 10:

1.  Download and install ``MacPython 2.3 for Panther addons``.
    Python is already included in OS X 10.3 so only the addons are necessary at
    http://www.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython.html

2.  Download and install TclTkAqua from http://tcltkaqua.sourceforge.net/

3.  Run the PackageManager found in ``/Applications/MacPython-2.3`` and  
    install ``_tkinter-2.3-binary`` by clicking on the package in the list  
    and clicking the [Install:] button with ``Install dependencies`` checked.

4.  Download Leo (platform independent source.zip) from http://leo.sourceforge.net/

5.  Unzip the contents into a directory by double-clicking the downloaded file.
    Typically you would put the Leo folder into the ``Applications`` directory.

6.  Control-click on ``/path_to_unzipped_dir/leo/src/leo.py`` and open with ``PythonLauncher``.

7.  It is a good idea to set ``PythonLauncher`` as the default program to  
    open python scripts by clicking on ``leo.py``, choosing Get Info from the  
    Finder's File menu, and selecting "PythonLauncher" as the default  
    program to ``Open With:``
    By clicking the ``Change All...`` button, all python scripts will be  
    opened with ``PythonLauncher``.
    
8.  Download ``Pmw`` from http://pmw.sourceforge.net/
    ``Pmw`` must be installed in order to use the Settings panel.
    Drag the downloaded gzip file into
    ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages``
    Double click on it to unzip and untar the file into a folder to make it available to Python</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070622180342">- Added support for chapters to Leo's core

  Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
  nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
  below) creates @chapter nodes as children of a single @chapters node.
  
  Selecting a chapter shows only then nodes in the selected chapter; in this
  respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
  outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
  creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
  except the 'main' chapter.
  
  Associated settings:
      
  - The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
  - The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
    pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

  When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:
      
  - The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
  - The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
  - The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
  - The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
    add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070622185234">The 'official' way to start a replace command is::

    &lt;Ctrl-shift-r&gt;find-pattern&lt;return&gt;replace-text&lt;return&gt;

But suppose you with start with::
    
    &lt;ctrl-f&gt;find-pattern

and then realize you want to do a replace instead of a find.
No problem.  The following also works::

    &lt;Ctrl-f&gt;find-pattern&lt;Ctrl-shift-r&gt;replace-text&lt;return&gt;
    
In other words, you can think of `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;` as meaning 'show the find dialog'.
There is another trick you should know.
After typing `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;` or `&lt;shift-ctrl-r&gt;` you can use `&lt;alt-ctrl&gt;` keys to set or clear find options.
For example::

    &lt;ctrl-f&gt;&lt;alt-ctrl-w&gt;&lt;find-pattern&gt;&lt;return&gt;

That is, `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;`shows the find dialog,
`&lt;alt-ctrl-w&gt;` toggles the Whole Word checkbox and
`&lt;return&gt;` starts the search.
You can type the `&lt;alt-ctrl&gt;` keys anytime after `&lt;ctrl-f&gt;` (or `&lt;shift-ctrl-r&gt;`) and before `&lt;return&gt;`. 
You can also type multiple `&lt;alt-ctrl-keys&gt;` to toggle multiple checkboxes.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20070623145346.1">Leo's setup.py script is intended only to create source distributions. It can't
be used to install Leo because Leo is not a Python package.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070623145346.2">Chapters are regions of a Leo outline whose root is an @chapter node. @chapter
nodes may appear anywhere in an outline, but the create-chapter command (see
below) creates @chapter nodes as children of the first @chapters node in the outline.

Selecting a chapter shows only then nodes in the selected chapter; in this
respect, chapters are like hoists. The main chapter represents the entire
outline and can not be deleted by name. When chapters are in effect, Leo
creates a hidden @chapters node containing one @chapter node for every chapter
except the 'main' chapter.

Associated settings:
  
- The @bool use_chapters setting determines whether chapters are enabled.
- The @bool use_chapter_tabs setting determines whether the chapters
  pop-up menu appears in the icon area. Choosing a chapter name from this list selects a chapter.

When chapters are enabled, the Cmds:Chapters menu shows all available chapter commands:
  
- The create-chapter command creates an @chapter node and with a single node.
- The delete-chapter command deletes the presently selected chapter.
- The select-chapter command makes only the nodes of the selected chapter visible.
- The move-node-to-chapter, clone-node-to-chapter and copy-node-to-chapter commands
  add a node (and its descendants) to another chapter.</t>

|back| |leo| |next|</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628084351">**@test nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @test. The unit test
commands convert the body text of @test nodes into a unit test automatically.
That is, Leo's unit test commands automatically create a unittest.TestCase
instances which run the body text of the @test node. For example, let us
consider one of Leo's actual unit tests. The headline is::
    
    @test consistency of back/next links
    
The body text is::

    if g.unitTesting:
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional: prevents pychecker warnings.
        for p in c.allNodes_iter():
            back = p.back()
            next = p.next()
            if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
            if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)
            
When either of Leo's unit test commands finds this @test node the command will
run a unit test equivalent to the following::
    
    import leoGlobals as g

    class aTestCase (unittest.TestCase):
        def shortDescription():
            return '@test consistency of back/next links'
        def runTest():
            c,p = g.getTestVars()
            for p in c.allNodes_iter():
                back = p.back()
                next = p.next()
                if back: assert(back.getNext() == p)
                if next: assert(next.getBack() == p)
                
As you can see, using @test nodes saves a lot of typing:
    
- You don't have to define a subclass of unittest.TestCase.
- Within your unit test, the c, g and p variables are predefined, just like in Leo scripts.
- The entire headline of the @test node becomes the short description of the unit test.

**Important note**: notice that the first line of the body text is a **guard line**::
    
    if g.unitTesting:
        
This guard line is needed because this particular @test node is contained in the
file leoNodes.py. @test nodes that appear outside of Python source files do not
need guard lines. The guard line prevents the unit testing code from being
executed when Python imports the leoNodes module; the g.unitTesting variable is
True only while running unit tests.

Note: Leo predefines the c, g, and p variables in @test and @suite nodes,
just like in other scripts.  Thus, the line::
    
    c,p = g.getTestVars()
    
is not needed.  However, it prevents pychecker warnings that c and p are undefined.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628090657.2">test.leo and leoPy.leo contain two unit testing buttons::
    
    @button unit-tests @key=Alt+4
    @button all-unit-tests @key=Alt+5

The script in the unit-tests button is::

    import leoTest
    leoTest.runTestsExternally (c,all=False)
    
The script in the all-unit-tests button is::

    import leoTest
    leoTest.runTestsExternally (c,all=True)

As you can see, each button writes a message, and calls runTestsExternally.
The only difference in these scripts is the 'all' argument.

These buttons create bindings for the 'unit-tests' and 'all-unit-tests' commands.
Alternatively, you can dispense with these buttons and instead use the
run-unit-tests and run-all-unit-tests commands directly.
As always, you can create bindings for these commands in leoSettings.leo or myLeoSettings.leo.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.1">**@suite nodes** are nodes whose headlines start with @suite. @suite nodes allow
you to create and run custom subclasses of unittest.TestCase.

Leo's test commands assume that the body of an suite node is a script that
creates a suite of tests and places that suite in g.app.scriptDict['suite'].
Something like this::

    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport' # Prevents pychecker complaint.
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        &lt;&lt; add one or more tests (instances of unittest.TestCase) to suite &gt;&gt;
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite
        
**Note**: as in @test nodes, the guard line, 'if unitTesting:', is needed only if the
@suite node appears in a Python source file.

Leo's test commands first execute the script and then run suite in
g.app.scriptDict.get('suite') using the standard unittest text runner.

You can organize the script in an @suite nodes just as usual using @others,
section references, etc. For example::
    
    if g.unitTesting:
        __pychecker__ = '--no-reimport'
        import unittest
        c,p = g.getTestVars() # Optional.
        # children define test1,test2..., subclasses of unittest.TestCase.
        @others 
        suite = unittest.makeSuite(unittest.TestCase)
        for test in (test1,test2,test3,test4):
            suite.addTest(test)
        g.app.scriptDict['suite'] = suite
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070628094515.2">Leo's unit tests commands do the following:
    
1. Copy all @test, @suite and @unit-test nodes (including their descendants) to the
   file test/dynamicUnitTest.leo.
   
2. Run test/leoDynamicTest.py in a separate process.

   - leoDynamicTest.py opens dynamicUnitTest.leo with the leoBridge module.
     Thus, all unit tests get run with the nullGui in effect.
        
   - After opening dynamicUnitTest.leo, leoDynamicTest.py runs all unit tests
     by executing the leoTest.doTests function.
    
   - The leoTests.doTests function searches for @test and @suite nodes and
     processes them generally as described above. The details are a bit
     different from as described, but they usually don't matter. If you *really*
     care, see the source code for leoTests.doTests.
        
That's all.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070629130418">On startup, Leo looks for two arguments of the form::

    --script scriptFile

If found, Leo enters batch mode. In batch mode Leo does not show any windows.
Leo assumes the scriptFile contains a Python script and executes the contents of
that file using Leo's ``Execute Script`` command. By default, Leo sends all
output to the console window. Scripts in the scriptFile may disable or enable
this output by calling ``app.log.disable`` or ``app.log.enable``

Scripts in the scriptFile may execute any of Leo's commands except the ``Edit Body``
and ``Edit Headline`` commands. Those commands require interaction with the user.
For example, the following batch script reads a Leo file and prints all the
headlines in that file::

    path = r"c:\prog\leoCVS\leo\test\test.leo"
   
    g.app.log.disable() # disable reading messages while opening the file
    flag,newFrame = g.openWithFileName(path,None)
    g.app.log.enable() # re-enable the log.
    
    for p in newFrame.c.allNodes_iter():
        g.es(g.toEncodedString(p.headString(),"utf-8"))
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070630083055">Sometimes the code in an @test or @suite node requires other nodes. The
@unit-test node groups nodes so that all nodes are available when running unit
tests. That is, all nodes in an @unit-test are copied to
test/DynamicUnitTest.leo. (See `How the unit test commands work`_ for full details.)</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070701090840">Leo is not your ordinary text editor, class browser, project manager or database manager,
though it resembles these programs in some respects.
Understanding what Leo is does take some work:
many people have reported an 'Aha!' experience when they first understand what Leo is all about.

Leo is built on simple foundations:
    
- Leo is an outliner. All Leo data resides in an `outline`_. Outlines can
  contain text, computer programs, web sites, pictures, or any other kind of
  data. Leo can show such information, including pictures and movies, directly
  in the outline.
  
- Using `cloned nodes`_, you can put the same information (outline node) in
  multiple places. You don't have to decide, once and for all, where the 'right'
  place to put data: you can 'file' information in as many places as you like.
  But Leo is more than just the ultimate filing cabinet. Using clones, an
  outline can, in effect, show multiple views of the data *in that outline*.
  Again, you do not have to decide, once and for all, which is the 'right' view.
  You can have as many views as you like. For example, suppose you have an
  outline that contains all of your slides (or links to them.) Using clones, any
  of your slides could appear in as many slideshows as you like.

These features allow you to organize personal information such as web links or
pictures. Other features make Leo a powerful environment for programming and web
development:
    
- Unlike most file and class browsers, Leo has a memory. Leo allows you complete
  freedom to organizer and reorganize your outline as you like. Leo remembers
  the organization and expansion state of your outline when you save it, and
  restores the outline and expansion state when you reload the outline.
    
- Leo is a virtual file system and data manager. Leo can generate files based on
  data contained in outline. Such `derived files`_ can contain anything that the
  outline contains: text, computer programs, pictures, etc.
  
- You can use outlines to organize your programs, data and scripts. Using a
  markup language based on noweb_, you can easily tell Leo how to assemble
  programs and scripts from text in a portion of an outline.
  
- Leo's import commands convert already-existing programs into Leo pre-organized
  outlines, much like class browsers do. Unlike class browsers, you are then
  free to reorganize the outline so that it is easy to understand. This is a
  great way to study other people's programs.
  
- The structure of Leo outlines is directly accessible to Python scripts.
  Scripts can directly access all nodes (headlines and body text) of an outline.
  There is no need to 'parse' data into constituent parts. Furthermore scripts
  can easily insert, delete and move nodes. For example, unit tests can create
  nodes that represent the expected result of a unit test.

- Any Leo script can easily be applied to a selected part of the outline. This
  is an incredibly powerful and flexible feature. For example, it is very easy
  to create 'text editing' scripts that automate tedious, repetitive programming
  tasks.
  
- It is easy to write `plugins`_ to alter any aspect of Leo's operation. Dozens
  of plugins already exist.
  
- Nodes naturally represent both data (body text) and its description or
  meta-data (headline). By convention, many plugins and commands look for
  headlines of the form @x. Examples include @test and @suite for unit tests,
  @url for web links, @slideshow and @slide for groups of slides, @auto for
  automatically imported files, @folder for nodes created automatically from a
  folder on the computer's file system, and many others.
  Two kinds of meta-data deserve special mention. Unit tests can easily define
  their own meta-data, such as 'before' and 'after'. These data describe the
  initial conditions of the unit tests and the expected result.
  The @rst plugin uses various kinds of @rst nodes to organize
  `reStructuredText`_ and to control how that text is organized. For full
  details, see `Chapter 14: Using the Rst3 Plugin`_.
  
- Leo coexists well with other editors such as Emacs and Vim. Leo has
  several plugins that allow you easily to switch between Emacs (or Vim) and
  Leo. Moreover, Leo allows you complete flexibility to use the key bindings you
  like.
  
Several people have asked me, "How can Leo help me with programming?".
Here is a short answer that summarizes the discussion so far:
    
- Leo's outlines allow you to see the organization of complex programs more
  clearly than with any other tool.
  
- Leo's allows you to organize programs and scripts more flexibly than with any
  other tool. In particular, noweb is a perfect match for outlines.
  
- Leo scripts are much more powerful than in other scripting environments
  because Leo scripts have easy access to headlines and data without having to
  parse data. **Outline structure is real data**: scripts can easily access the
  parents and descendants of any node. The practical benefits are almost
  endless.

- You can do things with Leo that are not possible with Emacs or Vim. In fact,
  you can do things with Leo that are not even *conceivable or expressible* with
  Emacs or Vim.

One last word. Leo has a strong and active community of users on `SourceForge`_.
Working with this community has been a constant source of joy and inspiration.
Suggestions and plugins from users continue to drive Leo in excellent new
directions. Who knows what the next plugin will bring? -- Edward K. Ream</t>

<t tx="ekr.20070704074439">As described later, Leo's unit tests commands copy various nodes to
test/dynamicUnitTest.leo, and then run these unit tests in a separate process.

The run-all-unit-tests command copies all @test, @suite nodes @unit-tests trees
and their descendants to test/dynamicUnitTest.leo.

The run-unit-tests command searchs for copies nodes to test/dynamicUnitTest.leo
as follows:
    
1. The run-unit-test command copies all @test and @suite nodes in all
   @mark-for-unit-tests trees.

2. The run-unit-test command copies all @test and @suite nodes in the presently
   selected tree. If the presently selected tree contains no such tree, it looks
   up the tree looking for @test, @suite and @unit-test nodes. If such a node is
   found, the run-unit-test command copies all @test and @suite nodes in the
   nodes tree.
   
In practice, these rules usually run the intended unit tests, namely all tests
in @mark-for-unit-tests trees and all unit tests 'near' the presently selected
node.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070704074747">Leo's **unit test commands**, run-unit-tests and run-all-unit-tests, run the unit
tests created @test and @suite nodes. The run-unit-tests command runs all unit
tests in the presently selected part of the Leo outline; the run-all-unit-tests
command runs all unit tests in the entire Leo outline.

**You must be running Leo from a console to see the output the unit tests**. Leo's
unit test commands run all the unit tests using the standard unittest text test
runner, and the output of the unit tests appears in the console.

Leo's unit test commands run all tests in a separate process, so unit tests can
never have any side effects. Running unit tests never changes the outline from
which the tests were run.

leoPy.leo, Leo's main source-code file, contains many examples of using @test and @suite nodes.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070723100037">Why, oh why, would anyone be interested in Leo? After all, Emacs and Vim are 
superb text editors, and Visual Studio and Eclipse are great IDE's. How can Leo possibly compete with such strong competition? What does Leo offer that these other tools don't? 

Leo does have something unique to offer--something missing from Emacs,Vim, Visual Studio and Eclipse. Leo's users often speak of an Aha! moment when they understand what this 'something' is. 
The Aha! arises from considering programs, design and data in a new light. You might call this 'The Leo Way'. In essence, Leo shows that computer programs, designs and data are *not*, after all, mostly about text. Yes, people usually *express* programs, designs and data as text. Yes, people manipulate programs, designs and data *using* text, but *text is not the whole story*. 
 
In The Leo Way, text is simply a manifestation (a shadow) of something more 
fundamental. That 'something else' might be called 'organization' or 'structure' or 'views' or even 'architecture'. However, let us use the term **node** to represent the fundamental unit of structure in Leo. We'll see why in a moment. 
 
In architectural terms, nodes are bricks that make up a building. In computer
programming terms, nodes make up methods, classes, files and entire
applications. So the term 'node' does *not* have a fixed meaning--it is simply a
unit of organization. Any node can be built from other nodes, and any node can
be used by any other node. Leo represent nodes directly, as nodes (headlines) in
an outline. An outline node contains a headline and body text. The **outline
pane** shows all headlines; the **body pane** shows the body text of the
presently selected node.
 
**Outline structure is real data**
 
To repeat: the fundamental unit in Leo is *not* text. True, headlines and body *consist* of text, but a node is just not text, it is a true (Python) object. This means several specific things: 
 
1. Because nodes are true objects, Leo commands understand what a node is, and
   where a node fits into the entire outline. I'll say more about outline
   organization soon, but let me give an example. Every node has exactly one
   parent node, (except for top-level nodes that have no parents) and every node
   has zero or more children and zero or more siblings. A node's parent,
   children and siblings are real properties of the node, *completely
   independent* of the node's headline or body text. Furthermore, any of Leo's
   commands (or user-written scripts or plugins, the big sisters of user
   scripts.) can *easily* access the all aspects of an outline *without* having
   to parse any text whatsoever. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily do the
   following: get the root of the outline, the presently selected node in the
   outline, the parent, siblings, children or descendants of any node in the
   outline, etc., etc. Commands, scripts and plugins can easily insert, delete
   or move nodes, and can alter the headline or body text in any node. All this
   *without* parsing text.
 
2. Having nodes be true objects means that commands scripts and plugins can
   treat the headline text as *something truly different from* body text. The
   natural interpretation of headline text is as a description of the body text.
   This is important! Headlines often control Leo's commands. For example,
   headlines that start with @thin, @file, @asis, @auto, etc. serve to guide and
   control Leo's read and write commands. Headlines that start with @test,
   @suite and @mark-for-unit-tests guide Leo's unit testing commands. Moreover,
   it is easy to create new conventions for headlines that control user-written
   scripts or plugins. For example, plugins define specific meanings for
   headlines that start with @url, @rst, @bookmark, @slideshow, etc., etc. So
   the separation of headline and body text, **as true components of a node
   object**, is a very big deal.
 
3. One application of these ideas deserves special mention. Leo's scripting
   plugin provides support for @button nodes. The headline is @button
   &lt;command-name&gt;. The body text contains a script. When Leo opens a Leo
   outline, each @button node creates a command and an icon. Clicking the icon
   (or executing the command) applies the script in the @button node **to the
   presently selected outline**. That is, the script is executed in a context in
   which it is easy to get access to all aspects of the outline in which the
   script is embedded. This is a major advance in scripting. It allows you to
   'bring scripts to data', i.e., any part of an outline. In particular, it is
   very easy to create **editing scripts** that automate what would otherwise be
   boring and repetitive editing tasks.
 
**Leo outlines aren't your average outline**
 
Earlier I said that *any* node can be built from other nodes, and *any* node can be used by any other node. It takes a very special kind of outline for this to be possible. In a typical outline, such as Emacs outline mode, for example, nodes appear exactly once in the outline. This makes it impossible to 'reuse' nodes in multiple places. Leo removes that limitation: any outline node can be **cloned**, and clones can appear in as many places in an outline as you like. 
 
Cloned nodes are distinct: they must be distinct so they can be moved throughout the outline, but **cloned nodes share all their information**. That is, changing the headline or body text in a node instantly changes the headline and body text in all the other nodes cloned to it. Furthermore, similar remarks apply to the children and descendants of any node--changing any child (or other descendant) of a node, say node A, instantly makes corresponding changes to all nodes cloned to node A. 
 
Earlier I said that you can think of nodes as representing 'organization' or 
'structure' or 'views' or even 'architecture'. Clones are the crucial feature that allows this point of view. For example, we can build up multiple 'views' of data in an outline using clones as follows: 
 
- Create a 'view node' that will represent a *user-specified* view. 
 
- Clone all nodes that are to be part of the view, and move them so that each clone is a child of the view node. 
 
That's about all there is to it. The view node, and its children *is* a new view of the outline. This notion of 'view' is so important that Leo supports it directly. Leo's **chapters** are simply views created as I have just described. When you select one chapter, you only see the nodes of that chapter in Leo's outline pane. 
 
**Conclusions &amp; encouragements**
 
So Leo offers a new way to understand, organize and manipulate *any* kind of
complex data, including computer programs, *designs* of computer programs, web
sites, personal data, whatever. The Aha that I invite you to experience is this:
Outlines are more than mere eye candy. Having organization be real data creates
an entirely new dimension, literally and figuratively, in computer programming,
computer design and data organization, including web-site design, database
design, etc. Leo's commands use headline and body text in many creative ways. So
can you and your scripts. It's easy, it's fun, and it's revolutionary.

That's about it, except for some words of caution and advice: 
 
1. Leo has been under active development for over 10 years. The new world
   created by nodes is rich and varied. You won't learn it all in a day or so.
   Please be patient. Start by learning Leo's basic features as explained in the
   tutorial. You can learn more advanced features later.
 
2. Those of you who are comfortable with Emacs should feel pretty much at home
   with Leo. Leo has shamelessly stolen the best features of Emacs, including
   the minibuffer and many Emacs-like commands.
 
3. For those of you who are *not* comfortable with Emacs, please understand that
   you do *not* need to understand all of Leo's commands in order to use Leo.
   Start by ignoring the minibuffer. Later, the minibuffer can become your
   friend, but you can get the Aha! without it.

<t tx="ekr.20070724081553">This section contains code-level notes for the threading colorizer. You do not
need to understand this material in order to use the threading colorizer.

The threading_colorizer plugin uses a separate **helper thread** to compute the
ranges of text that should be colored. **The helper thread must not contain any
calls to Tk**. Tk is not thread safe--calling Tk in the helper thread will cause
hard crashes in the Tk dll. However, the code in the helper thread is gui
independent. The **main thread** contains all of Leo's code except for a helper
thread. The main thread contains all calls to Tk, all entry points to the
colorizer, and idleHandler, an idle-time handler.

Only one helper thread is ever active at any one time. If a keystroke occurs
while the helper thread is active, the colorizer code in the main thread sets
the killFlag ivar and calls join to wait for the helper thread to terminate. The
helper thread will terminate promptly because it looks at killFlag each time
through its main loop. Using a separate helper thread allows the main thread to
continue working while the helper thread computes. This allows Tk (in the main
thread) to respond to events. This in turn allows the colorizer code in the main
thread to kill the helper thread if it is still working.

**New in Leo 4.4.4**: the helper thread runs to completion before the main thread
uses any of its results. Thus, no thread locking is needed, an important
simplification. Once the helper thread completes, the main thread computes the
tags to be sent to Tk, and actually sends those tags. When the user is typing
rapidly, the colorizer will ignore the results of all helper threads except the
last.

**New in Leo 4.4.4**: After the helper thread generates the list of all requested
tags, the main thread uses a kind of sort-merge algorithm to compare the
existing tags (obtained from Tk) with the requested tags. In many cases, the
lists are the same and colorizer issues *no* calls to Tk. This is a sensational
optimization.  It absolutely minimizes the load on Tk.

**New in Leo 4.4.4**: When the 'interruptible' argument to the colorizer is False,
no threading is used and the main thread completely colors the entire text. This
must be done when multiple body editors are present.</t>

Leo 4.4.4 beta 1 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance.

- Support for @auto nodes.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.

<t tx="ekr.20070806095535.1">@auto trees allows people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in the files Leo generates. In contrast to @nosent, @auto trees can
change when the corresponding file changes outside of Leo.

Leo will automatically recreate (import) all @auto trees when reading a .leo
file, and will write all dirty @auto trees when saving a .leo file. There are
two exceptions to this statement:
    
1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @auto tree if
the root @auto tree is under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @auto nodes if a) they haven't been changed
or b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of informtion. An @auto tree
contains a significant amount of information if it has  children or if the
root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo creates @auto trees by parsing the corresponding derived file. Parsers
create descendant nodes of the @auto tree: one node for each class, method and
function in the derived file.

Parsers presently exist for C, elisp, Java, Pascal, PHP and Python. Leo
determines the language using the file's extension. If no parser exists for a
language, the entire body ofAn @auto tree contains a significant amount of information if it has any children or if the root node contains more than 10 non-blank lines. the derived file is copied to the body of the @auto
node.

Leo does not write the contents of @auto trees to .leo files. In this respect,
@auto trees work much like @thin trees. @auto trees whose root node is under the
scope of an @ignore directive *will* be written to the .leo, just like @thin
trees.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070806100055">All present parsers are short overrides of a powerful base parser class. Thus,
it would be simple to add support for other languages. See the node

@thin leoImport.py--&gt;Import--&gt;Scanners for createOutline

in leoPy.leo to see how easy it is to create new parsers.

</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070806101412">Three new commands in the File:Read/Write menu allow you to manually read and
write @auto nodes from the presently selected outline. As always, an @ignore
directive in the @auto node or its ancestors will suppress any of these
commands:

- The Read @auto Nodes (read-at-auto-nodes) command reads all @auto nodes in the
  presently selected outline. An @ignore directive will suppress this import.

- The Write @auto Nodes (write-at-auto-nodes) command writes all @auto nodes. An
  @ignore directive will suppress this import. Caution: the write will occur even
  if Leo has not previously read the @auto node.

- The Write Dirty @auto Nodes (write-dirty-at-auto-nodes) is the same as the
  write-at-auto-nodes command, except that only changed @auto trees are written.

Most users will rarely use these explicit commands, because reading and writing
.leo files handles @auto nodes well enough. However, you can use the
read-at-auto-nodes command to update @auto nodes without having to reload the
.leo file.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070809141529">Leo performs several checks to ensure that the result of importing an external
file will be equivlant to the file that writing the @auto tree would produce.

These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a
potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree
if any error is found. This @ignore directive prevents the @auto tree from
modifying the external file. If you @ignore directive, a later write of the
@auto tree will attempt to fix the problems that gave rise to the errors. There
are no guarantees however.

**Strict languages** are languages like Python for which leading whitespace is
especially significant. Before importing a file for a strict language, Leo
**regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines of the original source file.
That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to blanks depending on the value of
the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto node. Leo cannot guarantee to
reproduce the original source file exactly if problems are discovered while
regularizing leading whitespace.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create
the same file as the original file. For strict languages, the comparison must be
exact, or nearly so. For non-strict languages, differences in leading whitespace
generate warnings, not errors.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:
    
1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any suspected bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or functions in strict languages. An
   **underindented line** is a line that is indented less then the starting line
   of the class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not
   represent such lines exactly: every line of node implicitly has at least the
   indentation of any unindented line of the node.

Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines.
Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.</t>

What's New in Leo 4.4.4
##########################################

Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.
The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
    
- **The Great Graph Aha**: simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent arbitrary
  directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The graphed.py
  plugin is a direct result of this Aha. It allows you to create general graphs
  from Leo outlines.
  
- Support for **@auto nodes**.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.
  
- **@menus trees** in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- **@buttons trees** in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- A new, faster, **colorizer plugin** replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  
- New commands for **resolving cvs conflicts**.

- Leo's core is now compatible with jython.

- Improved the yank and yank-pop commands and added @bool add_ws_to_kill_ring setting.

- Improved the debug command: it now adds the following code to the beginning of debug scripts::
    
    class G:
        def es(s,c=None):
          pass
    g = G()
    
- Added the @bool rst3 strip_at_file_prefixes setting.

These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a
potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree
if any error is found. This @ignore directive prevents the @auto tree from
modifying the external file. If you @ignore directive, a later write of the
@auto tree will attempt to fix the problems that gave rise to the errors. There
are no guarantees however.

Before importing a file, Leo **regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines
of the original source file. That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to
blanks depending on the value of the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto
node. Leo also checks that the indentation of any non-blank line is not a
multiple of the indentation specified by the @tabwidth dirctive in effect for
the @auto node.

Leo cannot guarantee to reproduce the original source file exactly if problems
are discovered while regularizing leading whitespace. **Strict languages** are
languages such as Python for which leading whitespace must be preserved exactly
as it appears in the original source file. Problems during regularizing generate
errors for strict languages and warnings for non-strict languages.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create
*exactly* the same file as the original file. Such file comparison mismatches
generate errors unless the problem involves only leading whitespace for
non-strict languages. Whenever a mismatch occurs the first non-matching line is
printed.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:
    
1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any suspected bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or function. An **underindented
   line** is a line that is indented less then the starting line of the class,
   method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not represent such
   lines exactly: every line of node implicitly has at least the indentation of
   any unindented line of the node.

Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines.
Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20070814090306.3">Three commands in the File:Read/Write menu allow you to manually read and
write @auto nodes from the presently selected outline. As always, an @ignore
directive in the @auto node or its ancestors will suppress any of these
commands:

- The Read @auto Nodes (read-at-auto-nodes) command reads all @auto nodes in the
  presently selected outline. An @ignore directive will suppress this import.

- The Write @auto Nodes (write-at-auto-nodes) command writes all @auto nodes. An
  @ignore directive will suppress this import. Caution: the write will occur even
  if Leo has not previously read the @auto node.

- The Write Dirty @auto Nodes (write-dirty-at-auto-nodes) is the same as the
  write-at-auto-nodes command, except that only changed @auto trees are written.

Most users will rarely use these explicit commands, because reading and writing
.leo files handles @auto nodes well enough. However, you can use the
read-at-auto-nodes command to update @auto nodes without having to reload the
.leo file.

<t tx="ekr.20070814104719">You enable or disable plugins using @enabled-plugins nodes in leoSettings files (leoSettings.leo, myLeoSettings.leo or the .leo file being loaded).  See `Specifying settings`_ for full details of settings files.
    
The body text of the @enabled-plugins node contains a list of enabled plugins.
Notes:
    
- Leo attempts to load all plugins every time an @enabled-plugins node is seen.
   If the plugin has already been loaded, Leo silently ignores the request to
   re-enable the plugin. Leo never attempts to disable a plugin while processing
   enabled plugin strings. Thus, plugins enabled in an @enabled-plugins node in
   leoSettings.leo *will* be enabled regardless of the contents of any other

<t tx="ekr.20070816092449">Question and answer from plumloco.

Add the equivelent of::
 
    import sys 
    leosrc = "path/to/leo/src" 
    if leosrc not in sys.path: sys.path.append(leosrc) 
    import leoBridge 
 
at the head of each file that uses leoBridge.

The problem is not importing leoBridge itself but (if I use 'from leo.src') the
importing of plugins, who get a different leoGlobals from leoBridge, without
g.app etc, and so do not work if they rely on dynamic values in g.etc.

&gt; Why can't you simply add leo/src to sys.path in sitecustomize.py?  
 
Putting leo\src on the python path as you suggest would put forty python modules
in the global module namespace for all python programs when I want just one.
Also, I have a safe working copy of leo and a cvs/testing version. I would wish
to test any programs against the testing version while using the working
version, but both /src dirs can't be exposed at the same time.

&gt; Do you need plugins while running from the leoBridge? 
 
'Fraid so, at least the rst3 plugin. The solution I am using now is to place::
 
    sys.modules['leoGlobals'] = leoGlobals  
 
in leoBridge after import leoGlobals.

This, together with placing an empty __init__.py in leo/src, allows my scripts
to be portable over the several computers/platforms I need to use them on, and
makes testing scripts against multiple leo versions easy. It does mean that my
scripts are not portable to other leo users but that is not likely to be a
problem.</t>

A softish bug, but the use of findNodeInTree() in the UNL code can 
take you to the wrong place if more than one node in the tree has 
the same headString.  Patch below - can still go wrong if more than 
one sibling has the same name, but the UNL system doesn't have a 
solution for that.

An observation - the UNL jumping code will drop you as far down the 
path as it gets, i.e. you're moved to the last node that was one the 
path, even if the path ends before the last part of the UNL is 
reached.  This is ok, i.e. "this is as far as I could follow the 
UNL", the alternative would be to not move at all if the whole UNL 
can't be followed.

<t tx="ekr.20070915101157.168">When saving a .leo file, Leo now *reads* an @auto node if

1) the derived file exists,
2) an 'insignificant' amount of data exists in the @auto tree, and
3)the @auto node has not been read previously.

This promises to fix some quite awkward use cases.

The 'perfect import' code now is a bit more relaxed, especially for 'non-strict'
languages (all languages except Python):

- Leo leaves leading whitespace alone for non-strict languages.

- Leo complains about intermixed tabs and blanks in leading whitespace only for
strict languages.

- Leo ignores leading whitespace in the perfect import tests for non-strict
languages.

These changes mean that Leo might change a derived file if such a change occurs
only in leading whitespace in a non-strict language.</t>

Leo 4.4.4 beta 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance.

- Support for @auto nodes.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.
  
- New commands for resolving cvs conflicts.

<t tx="ekr.20070920092716">The so-called resolve-cvs-conflict project has resolved itself into small,
easily understood commands.
    
The **read-file-into-node** command prompts for a filename, and creates an node
whose headline is @read-file-into-node &lt;filename&gt; and whose body text is the
entire contents of the file.

The **write-file-from-node** command writes the body text of the selected not to a file.
If the headline of the presently selected node starts with @read-file-into-node
the command use the filename that follows in the headline. Otherwise, the
command prompts for a filename.
   
When a cvs conflict occurs, the user will:
    
- read the file into a node using the read-file-into-node command,

- fix the conflict, as with any other editor, and

- write the file with the write-file-from-node command.

Any file can be fixed in this way, including derived files and .leo files. The
only complication is that the user must not change sentinel lines. Two new
commands check the contents of a node: The **check-derived-file** and
**check-leo-file** commands tell whether a trial read of the presently selected
node can be done successfully. The check-derived-file command assumes the body
text is a derived file; the check-leo-file command assumes the body text is an
entire .leo file.

The **compare-leo-outlines** command prompts for another (presubably similar)
.leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main
window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.</t>

Leo 4.4.4 beta 3 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.
It's been a good month :-)

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- The Great Graph Aha (tm): simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent
  arbitrary directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The
  graphed.py plugin is a direct result of this Aha. The graphed.py plugin allows
  you to create general graphs from Leo outlines.
  
- @menus trees in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- @buttons trees in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- @auto nodes eliminate sentinels in derived files, thereby allowing people to
  collaborate using Leo more easily.
  
- New commands for resolving cvs conflicts.

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance and a new, elegant algorithm.
  
- Leo is now compatible with jython.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes and other minor improvements.

- Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&amp;). If present,

- If the command name in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents

<t tx="ekr.20071004103659">**The graph world is unnecessary because we can use Leo nodes and trees as data
to other graphing packages.** That is, Python scripts can build arbitrary graphs
using Leo's existing nodes and trees. And Python scripts can manipulate those
graphs. And Python scripts could do the reverse: manipulate the Leo outline by
traversing general graphs. So there is no need to complicate Leo's fundamental
data structures. Hurray! Instead, we build on the strengths of already existing
graphing packages.

The Great Graph Aha created the opportunity for immediate action:
 
1. test.leo contains the essential scripts to implement graphs in Leo files.
   These short, simple, self-contained, easily modifiable scripts make possible
   everything ever envisaged by the (now-defunct) graph world project::

    at-graph2graph: convert an @graph tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-networkx2graph: convert an @networkx tree to a NetworkX graph 
    at-networkx2at-graph: create an @graph tree from an @networkx tree.

The following methods exist for the convenience of plugins.

**g.enableIdleTimeHook(idleTimeDelay=100)**

Enables the "idle" hook. Afterwards, Leo will call the "idle" hook approximately every idleTimeDelay milliseconds.
Leo will continue to call the "idle" hook periodically until ``disableIdleTimeHook`` is called.

**g.disableIdleTimeHook()**

Disables the "idle" hook.


**c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable (self,menuName,table,openWith=0)**

This method adds items to the menu whose name is menuName.
The table argument describes the entries to be created.
This table is a sequence of items of the form ``(name,None,command)``:

- ``name`` is the command name.
- ``None`` was a shortcut in previous versions of Leo, but shortcuts for user-defined commands
  should now be defined in @shortcuts nodes.
- ``command`` is the routine to execute when the menu item is selected.
- An entry of the form ``("-",None,None)`` creates a separator line between menu items.


For example::

    table =
        ("Toggle Active Pane",None,self.OnToggleActivePane),
        ("-",None,None),
        ("Toggle Split Direction",None,self.OnToggleSplitDirection))
    c.frame.menu.createMenuItemsFromTable("Window",table)

If the ``openWith`` keyword argument is 1 the items are added to a submenu of the Open With menu.
However, it will be more convenient to use the ``createOpenWithMenuFromTable`` method to create the ``Open With`` menu.

**c.frame.menu.createNewMenu (self,menuName,parentName="top")**

This method creates a new menu:

- menuName is the name of the menu to be created.
- parentName is the name of the parent menu, or "top" if the menu is to created in the menu bar.

This method returns the menu object that was created, or None if there was a problem.
Your code need not remember the value returned by this method.  Instead, your code will refer to menus by name.

**c.frame.menu.createOpenWithMenuFromTable (self,table)**

This method adds items to submenu of the ``Open With`` menu item in the ``File`` menu.
The table argument describes the entries to be created.
This table is a sequence of items of the form ``(name,shortcut,data)``:

- name is the command name
- shortcut is the shortcut, or None to indicate no shortcut.
- data is a tuple of the form (command,arg,ext)
- command is one of "os.system", "os.startfile", "os.spawnl", "os.spawnv" or "exec".
- arg is an argument to be passed to the given command.
- ext is a file extension or None.

When the user selects the ``Open With`` item corresponding to the table item Leo executes ``command(arg)``.
If ``ext`` is not ``None``, the temp file has the given extension.
Otherwise, Leo computes an extension based on what ``@language`` directive is in effect.
For example::

    table = (
        ("Idle",   "Alt+Shift+I",("os.system",idle_arg,".py")),
        ("Word",   "Alt+Shift+W",("os.startfile",None,".doc")),
        ("Wordpad","Alt+Shift+T",("os.startfile",None,".txt")))
    
    top().frame.createOpenWithMenuFromTable(table)

**c.frame.menu.deleteMenu (self,menuName)**

Deletes the menu whose name is given, including all entries in the menu.

**c.frame.menu.deleteMenuItem (self,itemName,menuName="top")**

Deletes the item whose name is itemName from the menu whose name is menuName.
To delete a menu in the menubar, specify ``menuName="top"``.

**c.frame.menu.setRealMenuNamesFromTable(table)**

Translates names of menus and menu items into another language.  For example::

    table = (
        ("Help", "&amp;Aide"),
        ("About Leo...", "Au &amp;sujet de Leo..."),
        ("Online Home Page", "&amp;Page d'Accueil en ligne"),
        ("Open Online Tutorial", "Ouvrir &amp;Tutoriel en ligne"),
        ("Open LeoDocs.leo", "Ouvrir Leo&amp;Docs.leo"),
        ("Open LeoConfig.leo", "Ouvrir Leo&amp;Config.leo"),

I like doctests, often debug with g.es()
statements, and open winpdb to examine what's
going on.

I've a small patch to the debug command
leoEditCommands.py--&gt;debugCommandsClass--&gt;debug
to simplify this.

The patch writes the following to the beginning of
the script being debugged;

class G:
def es(s,c=None):
  pass
g = G()

This makes the g.es() statements legal.

The patch also checks for doctests in the script,
and if found, converts them to regular code.

A node containing;

&gt;&gt;&gt; import inspect, sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; insp = sys.modules['inspect']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print insp.__name__
inspect
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.es(dir(insp))

can be run as a doctest;
&lt;alt x&gt; dt
(if the dtest.py plugin is active)

or sent to winpdb;
&lt;alt x&gt; debug

The patch doesn't change the handling of regular scripts.

It goes right after;
if not winpdb: return

#check for doctest examples
try:
    import doctest
    parser = doctest.DocTestParser()
    examples = parser.get_examples(script)

    # if this is doctest, extract the examples as a script
    if len(examples) &gt; 0:
        script = doctest.script_from_examples(script)

except ImportError:
    pass

# special case; debug code may include g.es("info string")
# insert code fragment to make this expression legal outside Leo
hide_ges = "class G:\n def es(s,c=None):\n  pass\ng = G()\n"
script = hide_ges + script

Leo 4.4.4 beta 4 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&amp;package_id=29106

This beta 4 version fixes all bugs reported against Leo 4.4.4 beta 3.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- The Great Graph Aha (tm): simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent
  arbitrary directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The
  graphed.py plugin is a direct result of this Aha. The graphed.py plugin allows
  you to create general graphs from Leo outlines.
  
- @menus trees in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- @buttons trees in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- @auto nodes eliminate sentinels in derived files, thereby allowing people to
  collaborate using Leo more easily. **Warning**: for now, please make backup
  copies of files imported with @auto.
  
- New commands for resolving cvs conflicts.

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance and a new, elegant algorithm.
  
- Leo is now compatible with jython.

- Better support for icons in headlines.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes and other minor improvements.

The atFile read logic only **adds** nodes, it never deletes nodes. Thus,
the 'changed2' node 'survived' the atFile read logic. The 'changed2' node became
a 'vampire' node that couldn't be killed.

The fix will require some care. The present atFile.read logic is robust because
it *doesn't* delete nodes. I suspect the solutions will be as follows:

A. The atFile.read code can not delete the subtree of @thin nodes initially,
because it doesn't know whether there will be read errors later. If there are
read errors absolutely nothing must change. This ensures that read errors never
destroy information.

B. A new post-pass will look for vampire nodes: nodes that were not actually
read from the derived file. I think (but haven't proven) that all descendents of
vampire nodes are also vampire nodes. If that is so the post-pass will simply
delete vampire nodes without worrying about whether they have descendents.

An argument I'm always having with leo has to do with its conversion of file
paths to 'absolute' forms.

In the file browser I select '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.
Leo reinterprets this as '/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'

Then I switch machines, and while
'/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' would still be valid,
'/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' isn't - on the other machine it
would be '/media/hdb1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.

I end up with the two entries in recent files, having to identify the right one.

If the Tk dialog is returning '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo', which I assume it is
because that's what it's displaying, I wish leo would use and store that.

Bah - I just now looked at it closely enough to realize it's the evil
pickled Tk classes in cleo uAs.  So I don't know whether you want to
fix that or not, it makes sense Leo would read the file specified on
the command line before Tk is initialized - if it's just scanning for
settings maybe it could catch and ignore failed uA reads at that time?

At some point I want to take pickled Tk vars out of cleo, I was
thinking when that guy was working on the wx gui would be a good time,
too bad he got sick.

I have clones that traverse chapters.

Given the following Chapters:

&gt; Main
&gt; Big Picture
&gt; Smaller Chunk

I have in Main, my organization, with my group in it.  It's also cloned around
all the other views (really, everything starts in the Big Picture).

This is the layout of my clone:

1:  Chapter:Main &gt; me
2:  Chapter:Main &gt; MyOrg &gt; me
3:  Chapter:Big Picture &gt; CEO &gt; Some Big Honcho &gt; MyOrg &gt; me
4:  Chapter:Smaller Chunk &gt; Some Big Honcho &gt; MyOrg &gt; me

If I Go-To-Next-Clone  (ALT-N) from (1), focus will move to the selected node
in Chapter:Main, namely (2).

So here's the issue: 

Let each successive line below represent a starting focus, and the next line
the node that ALT-N selects.  If focus changes in the Outline pane (including
Chapter pane change) to match the Node, that case is marked with [f] - a successful
focus transition.

The issue are the lines w/o [f];  Here's a couple of test runs.

1: [f] (starting node / focus)
2: [f]
3:
4:
1: [f]

Next test:

3: [f]
1: [f]
1: [f]
4:
3:
1: [f]

Next test:

4: [f]
3:
1: [f]
2: [f]
4:
3:
1: [f]
2: [f]
... and so on...

In cases with NO [f], the outline pane seems moved to the "end", but no node
selected.

Not a show stopper, but a bug nonetheless.

<t tx="ekr.20071210094621">This following is adapted from Terry Brown's entry in Leo's wiki.

You can not just run leoBridge from Leo, because the leoBridge module is design
to run a separate copy of Leo. However, it is possible to run leoBridge from a
subprocess. That turned out to be more, um, interesting than anticipated, so I'm
recording the results here.

The idea is that script A running in Leo (i.e. in a regular GUI Leo session)
calls script B through subprocess.Popen(), script B uses LeoBridge to do
something (parse unloaded Leo files), and returns the result to script A.
Passing the result back via the clipboard seemed like a possibility, but
XWindows / tcl/tk clipboard madness being what it is, that didn't seem to work.

First trick, calling script B from script A::

    import subprocess
    p = subprocess.Popen(('python',
        path_to_script_B,
        parameter_for_script_B,),
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        env={'PYTHONPATH': g.app.loadDir,'USER': g.app.leoID},
    )
    p.wait()

Setting PYTHONPATH in the environment seemed like the easiest way to let
script B find leoBridge.py (which it needs to import).  But by setting the
env parameter you limit script B's environment to be **only** PYTHONPATH,
which causes leoBridge to fail because, in unix at least, it depends
on USER in the environment.  So you need to pass that through too.

Now, because passing stuff back on the clipboard seems unreliable, at least
in XWindows, script B passes results back to script A via stdout (print),
but there's some Leo initialization chatter you want to avoid.  So put a
sentinel, 'START_CLIPBOARD', in the output, and collect it like this::

    response = p.stdout.readlines()
    while response and 'START_CLIPBOARD' not in response[0]:
        del response[0]
    del response[0]  # delete the sentinel as well
    response = ''.join(response)

This is the basic mechanism.  What I *actually* wanted to do was have script
B generate a branch of nodes and pass that back to script A for insertion in
the tree script A is running in.  That's relatively easy if you use::

    c.setCurrentPosition(pos_of_branch_to_return)
    c.copyOutline()
    print '&lt;!-- START_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'
    print g.app.gui.getTextFromClipboard()
    print '&lt;!-- END_CLIPBOARD --&gt;'

at the end of script B, and back in script A, after you've rebuilt
`response` as shown above, just::

    g.app.gui.replaceClipboardWith(response)
    c.pasteOutline()

</t>

It seems in derived files you can delete some text and save, causing the derived
file to be written and all dirty flags cleared.  But then undo makes the text
come back, as expected, but save only saves the outline, because the dirty flag
wasn't set on the node in which the text was restored by undo.</t>

<t tx="ekr.20071217092203.138">The patch attached against leoConfig.py (current CVS) adds a machine
specific config file to the config files Leo loads.

I synchronize files between multiple (3) machines. This means I can't
use different myLeoSettings files on each.

Tk fonts are screen dpi sensitive.  But (in Linux at least)
Tk's attempts to switch a font you picked to something equivalent at a
different dpi always result in a font that looks terrible.

So every time I switch machines I edit ~/myLeoSettings.leo to move the
font defs I picked for the current machine to the bottom of the body
text for the appropriate settings node, and then restart Leo.

This patch means I don't have to do that any more.  I'm sure there are
other uses for it.  Python doesn't seem to have a generic machine name
finding function, hence the sequence of alternatives.</t>

- There was a horrendous bug in the match_seq_regexp matcher which could cause the colorizer to loop.
- There was another horrendous bug in match_regexp_helper that cause spurious matches.
- Added some more defensive code to have the colorizer recover more gracefully in this case. 
- The jedit2py script was not associating regexp rules whose regex starts with
  '\' with the proper character. The proper character is the hash_char
  character, not the '\' character. As a result, regexp's that start with '\'
  never got matched.

############################################################
Chapter 21: IPython and Leo
############################################################

To use this plugin, you must run Leo from a console window. When this plugin is
enabled, Leo's start-ipython command starts IPython_ in this console. Leo's
ipython plugin provides two-way communication (a bridge) between Leo and
IPython: you can run Leo scripts from IPython, and IPython scripts from Leo.

Remarkably, Leo and IPython run simultaneously in the same process,
yet their separate event loops do not interfere with each other.
Even more remarkably, scripts run from IPython *immediately* change Leo,
*exactly* as if the script were run from Leo.
Conversely, scripts run from Leo *immediately* affect the IPython interpreter.
Care may be needed when running such scripts while lengthy IPython scripts are running.
As the result of this truly remarkable connection between Leo and IPython,
Leo might plausibly be said to be an `IPython Notebook`_.

The bridge between Leo and IPython is powerful because it is simple. Indeed,

1. **You can run any IPython script from Leo**.
On the Leo side, as single variable::

    ip = c.ipythonController.ip
    
assigns ip to IPython's _ip variable. The ip variable allows scripts running in
Leo to do *anything* that an IPython script can do.

2. **You can run any Leo script from IPython**. 
The ipython plugin injects a single object, typically called leox,
into the IPython namespace. IPython scripts access Leo's c and g objects as
follows::

    c,g = leox.c, leox.g
    
The c and g variables allow scripts running in IPython to do *anything* that a
Leo script can do.

<t tx="ekr.20080204100523">This plugin creates an instance of the **ipythonController** class for each Leo
window. The ipythonController objects manage a singleton instance of IPython's
IPShellEmbed class. See http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node9.html. Creating
this singleton instance starts IPython running in the console from which Leo was
run. As mentioned in the introduction, Leo and IPython appear to run
simultaneously. Their event loops do not interfere with each other.

The term **startup time** refers to the time that the singleton IPython instance is created.

Initializing Leo from IPython is easier than initializing IPython from Leo.
Indeed, the start-ipython command typically blocks and never returns, so it is not possible
to schedule a Leo script to be run after the start-ipython command returns.
Instead, it will typically be more convenient to use IPython's normal facilities to
schedule a script that initializes Leo when IPython starts.

The start-ipython command starts IPython running in the console and injects leox, a
**Leo Interface Object** into IPython's user namespace.
Using the leox object, IPython scripts can gain access to Leo's c and g variables::

    c,g = leox.c,leox.g
    
Thus, IPython scripts can do *anything* that can be done in Leo.
See `Scripting Leo from IPython`_ for full details.

Conversely, Leo scripts can gain access to IPython's _ip variable::

    ip = c.ipythonController.ip

Thus, Leo scripts can do *anything* that can be done in IPython.
See `Scripting IPython from Leo`_ for full details.</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080204100523.1">This plugin creates the following Leo commands commands:

- The start-ipython command starts the singleton IPython instance running in the
  console and injects a Leo Interface Object into IPython's user namespace.
  **Run the start-ipython command before running the other commands**.
  
  
  **Important**: The start-ipython command blocks. That is, the command does not
  finish execution until IPython exits. In a typical workflow, IPython exits
  after Leo does, so the the start-ipython command *never* completes.
  
  Remarkably, this does not affect Leo's main loop: Leo itself does not block.
  However, because the start-ipython command blocks, it is not possible for the
  command to do any follow up initialization of IPython. In practice, this does
  not matter, because IPython provides several ways of executing scripts on
  startup. In short, it is often more convenient to initialize Leo from IPython
  than to initialize IPython from Leo.
  
- The push-to-ipython command pushes data to IPython.
  By default, it executes the body text of the presently
  selected node in IPython.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080204100523.2">Just as c and g provide full access to all aspects of Leo,
IPython's _ip var (and _ip.IP) provide full access of all of IPython's internals.
See extensionAPI_ for details.
The following script sets ip to IPython's _ip var::

    ip = c.ipythonController.ip # set ip to IPython's _ip var.
    
With ip defined as above, IPython scripts **running in Leo**
can do anything that a script running in IPython can do.

Leo scripts can simulate this plugins's minibuffer commands as follows.

To simulate the start-ipython command::

    x = c.ipythonController
    if x and not x.started(): x.startIPython()

To simulate the push-to-ipython command::

    x = c.ipythonController
    if x and x.started(): x.pushToIPython()

To run a given script in IPython::

    x = c.ipythonController
    if x and x.started(): x.pushToIPython(script=script)
    </t>
<t tx="ekr.20080204100523.3">This plugin honors the following user options, defined in leoSettings.leo, etc.

- \@string ipython-interface-object-name = leox 

  The name of the interface object injected into IPython when the bridge is created.
  
- \@string 'ipython-results-node-headline' = @ipython-results

  The headline of the root of all results nodes created by the get-ipython-results command.
 
**Important**:
As discussed in `Scripting Leo from IPython`_ scripts running in IPython can easily
support many other Leo settings. The following settings are **not** supported
directly by the ipython plugin, but they indicate the kinds of settings that
IPython scripts might find useful:

- \@data ipython-bridge-startup-script

  The body text contains a script to be executed at startup time.
  
- \@data ipython-bridge-auto-open-leo-files

  The body text contains a list of .leo files to be opened automatically
  at startup time.
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080205080801">The start-ipython command injects the leox object into IPython's
user namespace.
The c and g ivars of the leox object are
the leoGlobals module and
the commander of the Leo outline that created the IPython shell, respectively.
Thus scripts **running in IPython** can do *anything* a Leo script can do.
For, such scripts can insert and delete nodes in Leo outlines.
The changes will become visible as soon as the script (running in IPython)
redraws the screen.

See `Chapter 7\: Scripting Leo with Python`_ for full details about how to script
Leo.  The following are merely examples about what can be done from IPython.
All these examples have been tested.

1. g.app.windowList is a list of all open Leo frames, so an IPython script can
   get a list of all commanders as follows::

    c,g = leox.c, leox.g
    commanders = [f.c for f in g.app.windowList]
    
2. IPython scripts can use the c.config object to get Leo settings.
   Suppose the body text of an @data
   ipython-bridge-startup-script setting contains a script to be executed when
   ipython starts up. An Ipython script can get that startup script as follows::

    c = leox.c
    startupScript = c.config.getData('ipython-bridge-startup-script')
    
3. Suppose the body text of an @data ipython-bridge-auto-open setting contains a
   list of .leo files to be automatically opened on startup. The following
   IPython script opens those files::

    c,g = leox.c, leox.g
    files = c.config.getData('ipython-bridge-auto-open-leo-files')
        # getData strips lines starting with '#'.
    for z in files:
        fileName = g.os_path_abspath(g.os_path_join(g.app.loadDir,z))
        g.openWithFileName(fileName, old_c=c)
</t>
<t tx="ekr.20080210101336">This plugin would not have been possible without the help of Ville M. Vainio.
Discussions_ on SourceForge show how the goal of close cooperation between Leo and IPython went from
vague dream to completed reality over the span of about 10 days.</t>
