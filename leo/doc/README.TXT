Leo 4.4 release candidate 1                                 April 28, 2006

This version fixes a few minor bug reported in 4.4b4 and adds 9 new commands. The open-outline-by-name command supports filename completion.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:

The highlights of Leo 4.4:
--------------------------
- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring, regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs, Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.

- Dozens of other new features and bug fixes since Leo 4.3.3.
