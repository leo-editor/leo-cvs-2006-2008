Leo 4.4.3 alpha 2                                  March 17, 2006

Leo 4.4.3 alpha 2 is available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&package_id=29106

This version of Leo should be safe enough for production use. It is an alpha
distribution because not all plugins have been tested on the reorganized code
base.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

The highlights of Leo 4.4.3:
----------------------------
- A leoBridge module that allows full access to all of Leo's capabilities
  from programs running outside of Leo.
- Added support for @enabled-plugins nodes in settings files.
- The__wx_gui plugin is now functional.
- Removed all gui-dependent code from Leo's core.
- Better support for the winpdb debugger.
- Many minor improvements, new settings and bug fixes.
