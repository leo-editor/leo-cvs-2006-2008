http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3458&package_id=29106

This beta 4 version fixes all bugs reported against Leo 4.4.4 beta 3.

Leo is a text editor, data organizer, project manager and much more. See:
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html

Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.

The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:
----------------------------

- The Great Graph Aha (tm): simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent
  arbitrary directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The
  graphed.py plugin is a direct result of this Aha. The graphed.py plugin allows
  you to create general graphs from Leo outlines.

- @menus trees in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- @buttons trees in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- @auto nodes eliminate sentinels in derived files, thereby allowing people to
  collaborate using Leo more easily.

- New commands for resolving cvs conflicts.

- A threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.
  This plugin features much better performance and a new, elegant algorithm.

- Leo is now compatible with jython.

- Better support for icons in headlines.

- The usual assortment of bug fixes and other minor improvements.
