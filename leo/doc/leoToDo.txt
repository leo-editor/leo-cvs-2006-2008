I changed createSplitterComponents.

Here's a diff, which gives me a ":o" arrangement, which suits me fine.   Obviously,
inclusion in released code would need to make this dependent on an option.

By: terry_n_brown

Maybe it's not related to these other path issues, but an argument I'm always
having with leo has to do with its conversion of file paths to 'absolute' forms.
In the file browser I select '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.  Leo reinterprets
this as '/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'  Then I switch machines,
and while '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' would still be valid,
'/media/hda2/usr1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo' isn't - on the other machine it
would be '/media/hdb1/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo'.  I end up with the two entries
in recent files, having to identify the right one.

I haven't tested it, but if the Tk dialog is returning '/home/tbrown/misc/foo.leo',
which I assume it is because that's what it's displaying, I wish leo would use
and store that.

Vampire nodes from cvs

I've just discovered a major problem with cvs updates.  It is a subtle consequence of how Leo writes outlines and reads derived files.  This is a big bug in Leo, not cvs.  The effect of the bug is that nodes can appear in derived files that were never written to them!

The discovery of this 'big bug' came about as the result of the following Aha:

**@thin files that contain @all directives should be a cvs binary (-kb) files.**

The reason is straightforward:  cvs doesn't know enough to merge such files.  Maybe all @thin derived files should be -kb files, but Leo's users will never agree to that!

Anyway, leoProjects.txt is now a binary file as far as cvs is concerned.  Other .txt files, like leoScripts.txt, should also be binary files.  As we shall see, the fact that leoProjects.txt is now a -kb file means that we can not possibly blame the cvs merge algorithm for what is about to happen.

Ok, back to the 'big bug'.  Here is how I got bitten:

- I changed leoProjects.txt in two sandboxes 1 and 2.  In sandbox 1 I added a node called 'changed in the main line'.  In sandbox 2 I added a node called 'changed2'.

- I changed LeoPyRef.leo in sandbox 2, but *not* in sandbox 1.

- I did a update in sandbox 2.

As expected (now that leoProjects.txt is a binary file) I got the following from cvs:

M src/LeoPyRef.leo
...
cvs update: nonmergeable file needs merge
cvs update: revision 1.448 from repository is now in src/leoProjects.txt
cvs update: file from working directory is now in .#leoProjects.txt.1.447

To summarize the update:

- LeoPyRef.leo has been marked as modified (M), but it has **not** been changed by cvs.

- As expected, leoProjects.txt contains the version from sandbox **1**.

So far, so good.  But when I opened LeoPyRef.leo I got a huge surprise: the outline contains **both** the node 'changed in main-line' and the node 'changed2'.  Whoa Nellie!

How did this happen?  Well, obviously the 'changed in main-line' node came from the cvs update.  I expected that.  The 'changed2' line must have come from the local copy of LeoPyRef.leo.

Once I knew what to look for it wasn't too hard to discover what had happened.  The 'changed2' is a descendent of a cloned node called '4.4 projects'.

- One clone of '4.4 projects' node is a descendent of the @thin leoProjects.txt node.

- Another clone of the '4.4 project' is in the LeoPyRef.leo file but outside of any @thin node.

So the 'resurrection' of the 'changed2' node happened while Leo was reading leoProjects.txt into LeoPyRef.leo.  The '4.4 projects' node **already existed in the outline** before Leo read leoProjects.txt, and the present atFile read logic only **adds** nodes, it never deletes nodes.  Thus, the 'changed2' node 'survived' the atFile read logic.  The 'changed2' node became a 'vampire' node that couldn't be killed.

The problem is far from benign.  Because of clones, the vampire node became an orphan node in **another** file, namely leoKeys.py.  I tried two or three times to remove the vampire/orphan node before realizing what had happened.

The fix (there is *always* a fix) will require some care.  The present atFile.read logic is robust because it *doesn't* delete nodes.  It is essential that the read logic remain robust.  I suspect the solutions will be as follows:

A. The atFile.read code can not delete the subtree of @thin nodes initially, because it doesn't know whether there will be read errors later.  If there are read errors absolutely nothing must change.  This ensures that read errors never destroy information.

B. A new post-pass will look for vampire nodes: nodes that were not actually read from the derived file.  I think (but haven't proven) that all descendents of vampire nodes are also vampire nodes.  If that is so the post-pass will simply delete vampire nodes without worrying about whether they have descendents.

Warning: the new scheme will mean that cvs update can destroy information that previously existed in the outline.  I believe this is correct: we assume that derived files are the 'truly meaningful' files.  Hey, if we are wrong we can always get the old info from cvs :-)

From email from Terry Brown

python /home/tbrown/.gnome-desktop/Package/leo/cvs/leo/src/leo.py /home/tbrown/.tnb.leo

(should be all on one line, i.e. run and open /home/tbrown/.tnb.leo)

gives the traceback below.  Opening the file from within Leo works fine.

Bah - I just now looked at it closely enough to realize it's the evil
pickled Tk classes in cleo uAs.  So I don't know whether you want to
fix that or not, it makes sense Leo would read the file specified on
the command line before Tk is initialized - if it's just scanning for
settings maybe it could catch and ignore failed uA reads at that time?

At some point I want to take pickled Tk vars out of cleo, I was
thinking when that guy was working on the wx gui would be a good time,
too bad he got sick.

Recent posts have discussed @menu trees and resolving cvs conflicts. The third of my recent ruminations concerns adding support for vim-like key bindings. 

Earlier work involving input modes (@mode nodes in settings file) probably is not completely sufficient to implement plain-key key bindings in a way that would truly be vim-like. 

Most of the issues are implementation issues: Leo's key-handling code is very complicated. The trick is to handle both vim and emacs styles compatibly. 

The user must be able to specify vim-like key bindings without using @mode nodes. That is, top-level vim key bindings must always be available. Vim has an enormous number of key bindings: the user must be able to specify which are in effect. 

My strategy will be as follows: 

1. Create enter-vim-mode and exit-vim-mode commands, and create the setting: 

@bool vim-mode-by-default = False 

This will allow the user to specify vim mode as the default mode if desired. 

2. Create **vim-edit** commands as needed in order to handler user interaction. For example, dd deletes the present line while d5 deletes 5 lines. Rather than trying to simulate this effect using the present mechanisms, the vim-delete command will prompt for the number of characters or lines to delete. 

Give the complex nature of vims c and d commands (and others) it will probably be necessary to create a vim-edit class in leoEditCommands.py. This class will handle all the ways of specifying a range of characters to which the various commands will apply. It's not clear exactly how much work will be needed, but my guess is that it will, in fact, be easiest to handle vim-like interactions with new code. 

3. Vim's ':' command will simply invoke Leo's minibuffer. This isn't precisely the same as Vim's status line: it is significantly better. Otoh, we will want a way to simulate the actual spelling of vim's ':' commands. Possible @abbreviation nodes can be pressed into service. 

4. Internally, it will be quite a trick to allow top-level vim-like plain-key bindings in all text widgets. I'm not sure how to do this, but it is essential. 

I am quite eager to get something truly vim-like working. It promises to increase my editing speed substantially. It also should appeal strongly to present vim users.

*Many* calls to g.es and g.es_print have a mix of translated and untranslated items.
Untranslated items should include file names, directories, gnx's, leo_id's etc.

**Don't bother to do clone-find-all: there are 666 many matches!**

Regardless of the chosen scheme:

- g.translate will do the actual translation.

- Some simple string, like tr, will be an abbreviation for g.translate.
  The typical import will be::

    import leoGlobals as g ; tr = g.translate

The easiest scheme seems to be:

- g.es and g.es_print translate all arguments.
- g.esx and g.es_printx do no translation.

g.esx and g.es_printx allow a mix on translated and untranslated arguments::

    g.esx(tr('abc'),fileName)

One feature I have not seen in SCS system is something which might be called
"history compression": I might be interested in having both version 5 and 6
in my source tree, when the current version is 7, but I am not really interested
in the 2000 steps which transformed 5 into 6 (just suggested this feature to
the bazaar people). This happens actually quite often to me, since I use the
SCS as a back-up system, saving many (uninteresting) intermediate steps while

Actually we are talking about two plugins here: a bazaar plugin, and a
Leo plugin.

The bazaar plugin would do special things for Leo files during checkout, status
and checkin. After checkout, for example, it would delete the sentinels in the
user visible files.

The Leo plugin would know to go to the repository for reading (and writing?).

One open question is to where to store new sentinels: can they be hidden away
in the Source Control System (SCS) directories?

Another open question: Could Leo sentinels be used as an identity marker, which
unambiguously identifies a piece of text? With that, the SCS system might have
enough information to make statements like:

Lines 10-100 where in file x where moved from file y, in other words: the SCS
could track code at the function level.

The whole process could then work like this:

1. You check out your sources.
2. After checkout, the bazaar plugin would delete all sentinels from the checked-out
files.
3. If you start Leo, Leo would read the (full) file from the SCS.
4. If you make modifications, the full file would be hidden in SCS directories,
and the disk file would (again) show no sentinels.
5. I don't know how the bazaar status command works. We must make sure that
status works correctly for Leo files as it does for any other files.
6. For checkin, the SCS system would have to use the information hidden in step
4.

Open questions:

1. Can the Leo sentinels be used as a permanent identity markers for text? If
they can't be right now, would Edward be willing to modify them so that they
can?
2. Can / should we make the full files available somehow (probably)
2. How would conflict resolution work? Can / should we hide the sentinels even
then? (probably not)

So the answer to your question is: yes, I am thinking about such plugins, though
I am not (yet) thinking of writing such plugins myself.

This is just a nit I guess, but I move between two machines all the time, and
Leo keeps changing the paths I open from /home/tbrown/project/project.leo to
/media/hda8/project/project.leo, so that when I switch to the other machine,
where /home/tbrown/project/project.leo is actually /media/hdb2/project/project.leo,
the recent files link is wrong.

If it would be trivial for Leo to not do this, I'd like that feature.  If it's
a big deal, then not to worry, I can always navigate to the file of course.

Disabled these binding:

auto-complete-force         = None # This command needs work before it is useful. Ctrl-period
show-calltips-force         = None # This command needs work before it is useful. Alt-parenleft

The problem is that autocompletion depends on state: self.leadinWord,
prevObjects, etc. Thus, it's not presently possible to start the proces
anywhere. Similar remarks apply to calltips, which relies on autocompleter
state.

This is a complex problem, and not very serious now that there is an easy way of
toggling autocompleter and calltips on and off.

The new code is just barely enough to open a window with a nullGui for @button dynamic-tests.
**However**, it is just the start of what would be required to open a window and execute most operations on it.
In particular, throughout leoEditCommands.py we should substitute c.frame.gui (or self.gui) for g.app.gui.
But it's way too late in the Leo 4.4.3 release cycle to do that.

A lot of people are now using Wink for demonstrations
(http://www.debugmode.com/wink/), it's is free and seems to work well.

Check out http://murl.se/11332
At the bottom they talk about tools and techniques.
http://showmedo.com seems like it would be a good
place to host vids also.

I've listened/watched a fair number of things like this;
my recomendation is to get a good microphone and
pre-amp to record your voice, and prepare the audio
track carefully. It is so aggravating when
it's hard to discern the words being spoken.

Thanks,
Kent

Tutorials would be great. I use Liberty BASIC, (http://libertybasic.conforums.com)
and it has a very good tutorial -- leads the beginner by the hand through much
of the language. Also the help file has working code snippets
to cut-n-paste-n-play-with. I'd like to see something like:

[Buttons]
...[What are Buttons good for?]
...[How do I make my own buttons?]
......[Some commands you can use with buttons]
......[Where to find button commands]

My sense is that documentation/screencasts has the
greatest potential for expanding Leo's mindshare.

I really like those produced by the good folks
at Dabo;
http://leafe.com/screencasts/
http://leafe.com/screencasts/populategrid.html

The TurboGears people have taken this to the extreme;
http://www.turbogears.org/ultimate.html

Leo is different enough that it warrants a 
demonstration of it's advantages.

Three packages that might be candidates for "rendering" slides authored in Leo:

MagicPoint: http://member.wide.ad.jp/wg/mgp/

  uses a text file format that leo could produce

Slidy: http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/

  uses XHTML / canned Java script

S5: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/

  Similar to Slidy I think, haven't looked at it

Sorry to here about your injury, Edward. Hope its not RSI from working too hard
on Leo.  Get well soon.

When your fit and well again you might like to have a look at this.

I have been playing with custom tree widgets for leo, first with pyGTK then
with wxPython.  I had thought about doing a  pyGTK plugin until I realized how
much work was involved :)

I have adapted the __wx_gui.py plugin to work with my custom widget and called
it __wx_alt_gui.py. You, or anyone else who is interested, can download the
plugin from http://plumloco.co.uk/scratch/__wx_alt_gui.py.gz.

The great benefit of using this custom widget is that it has no secondary data
structures to keep in synch, this makes it faster and more efficient in terms
of resources. It also eliminates the problem of complicated glue code.

All that is needed is to call update whenever a change is made and the widget
will get all its data directly from the leo outline itself.  A good test for
the widget is to load a large outline and do an expand-all-nodes on it (try
the same with __wx_gui and tkLeo).

The widget still needs a lot of work but it works well enough for its usefulness
and viability to be tested.

I would be interested to know your intentions towards wxLeo.  My impression
is that you do not plan on being very active in its development, seeing as how
you are talking about doing a java swing version.

If you have no objections, I would like to do some work on wxLeo myself, partly
for its own sake and partly to gain experience for a possible pyGTK port.  Obviously
I do not want to be treading on your toes, so please tell me if I am intruding.

I guess its hard to say what pieces must merge and what can stay different.
Id like it if the blasted nodes were the same.  I guess there is progress again
on a jython 2.2 being complete and work starting on 2.3.  So there is hope that
the nodes will be the same code, at least it will be possible.

At the top of my head the big differences outside of the position changes are:
1. Some modifications to the read/write code so that Chapters can work and also
Serialized positions.
2. Commander has some things different, it looks to the Chapters instance to
determine what is the curentPosition, top Position etc... instead of keeping
track of it itself.
3. GUI layers are very different.  Interesting tidbit here: the work I did to
get the JTree to use positions to determine if a node is expanded or not looks
like it has provided the outline for enhancing the JTree for Java itself to
be able to do this.  We will have to see, but maybe in Java 7 you can say: "Positions
lead to user controled tree expansion models".

There is a tremendous amount that is the same. Im sure you could make an interesting
evening out of comparing the codebases to see where things change.

By: duanekaufman

I am starting a kinda 'stream-of-thought' document, one in which I can put down
a paragraph of thought (perhaps in a pretty fashion, using ReST markup), develop
some code, to do some calculations, run the code and display the results...rinse,
repeat.

The document, in pseudo-form, would look like:

<Development of thought #1>
<Code to calculate something>
<Results from code execution>
<Discussion of results>

Each of the above would probably be a node, and I have already put together
things that look like the above, all except for the <results> part. I can run
the code, but how can I get the output automatically in my node? I can cut-and-paste
from the underlying command window (I run under Linux and Windows XP), but I
would like o automate it as much as possible.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to accomodate this workflow?

------ Reply

A most interesting and important question--with such a capability one could make Leo into a full-fledged engineering notebook, e.g., as envisaged by the IPython Notebook project: 

http://projects.scipy.org/ipython/ipython/wiki/NbshellManual 

I can think of several possible approaches: 

1. Create a custom version of the execute script command that would put script output in a particular node. Perhaps the headline of the node could be an argument to the enhanced command. 

2. Have your script write to some 'standard place', and create a command to put that script in the presently selected node. Something like insert-script-output. 

3. Create a script button that executes the script in the presently selected node and puts the result in the node *following* the selected node. You can then either move the node by hand, or use another script button to move the node to a 'standard place', say the last child of the <<results>> node. 

As I write this I think the script-button approach is likely to be the simplest, most flexible and most powerful. I'll look into this myself soon...
