By: duanekaufman

I am starting a kinda 'stream-of-thought' document, one in which I can put down
a paragraph of thought (perhaps in a pretty fashion, using ReST markup), develop
some code, to do some calculations, run the code and display the results...rinse,
repeat.

The document, in pseudo-form, would look like:

<Development of thought #1>
<Code to calculate something>
<Results from code execution>
<Discussion of results>

Each of the above would probably be a node, and I have already put together
things that look like the above, all except for the <results> part. I can run
the code, but how can I get the output automatically in my node? I can cut-and-paste
from the underlying command window (I run under Linux and Windows XP), but I
would like o automate it as much as possible.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to accomodate this workflow?

------ Reply

A most interesting and important question--with such a capability one could make Leo into a full-fledged engineering notebook, e.g., as envisaged by the IPython Notebook project: 

http://projects.scipy.org/ipython/ipython/wiki/NbshellManual 

I can think of several possible approaches: 

1. Create a custom version of the execute script command that would put script output in a particular node. Perhaps the headline of the node could be an argument to the enhanced command. 

2. Have your script write to some 'standard place', and create a command to put that script in the presently selected node. Something like insert-script-output. 

3. Create a script button that executes the script in the presently selected node and puts the result in the node *following* the selected node. You can then either move the node by hand, or use another script button to move the node to a 'standard place', say the last child of the <<results>> node. 

As I write this I think the script-button approach is likely to be the simplest, most flexible and most powerful. I'll look into this myself soon...

I have just started the process of 'priming the pump' for work on @auto.

Here are the key factors that drive the design:

0. [Terminology] Alice uses Leo and doesn't mind having sentinels in derived files. Bob doesn't use Leo, and *does not want sentinels* (at least until Bob gets turned on to Leo), and Mike is Alice's and Bob's manager.  Mike probably doesn't care about sentinels, but would side with Bob if Bob objected to using sentinels.

1. [No sentinels] There was a *lot* of discussion about this.  The initial implementation of @auto will use *absolutely no* sentinels. This might be relaxed later, but the *essential* idea is that @auto is a feature primarily for newbies who DO NOT WANT sentinels in their files.  As Kent has clearly pointed out, within @auto trees, Alice can live without clones, section references and @others, etc.

2. [Perfect import] I designed an algorithm that guarantees that files imported with @auto can be rewritten from the @auto tree with *no* changes to the original file.  This is the 'round-tripping' requirement.

See: Huge aha: design of the parser (perfect import)
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4224283

3. [Resolve cvs conflicts] Leo can let the user resolve cvs conflicts.

Couldn't Leo make this distinction by looking at
the file being imported? If so, I think it should.

This could eliminate a lot of confusion IMO, if
I want to bring a file into a node, just
'import' it, and the right thing happens.

An emergency measure could be available in a

There have been a couple different suggestions on how to obtain a .leo file
that presents the conflicts for resolution.  My initial thought was to have
some sort of external file containing only the structure information of interest.
Edward has suggested that we could process the CVS created .leo file with all
its conflict indicators.

I'd like to offer another alternative: based on the ad-hoc procedure that Edward
is currently using, i.e.,

* Save your work to foo.leo file.
* copy your foo.leo file to fooCvsTmp.leo
* cvs ci
* if there are no conflicts (hurray)
*    remove fooCvsTmp.leo; finished
* otherwise
*    remove foo.leo
*    cvs up foo.leo
*    read foo.leo into an internal directed acyclic graph (DAG)
*    generate the conflict resolution DAG from the proposed new leo internal
DAG (which Leo already has as a matter of course) and the CVS derived DAG
*    present for editting
*    when you are satisfied and want to try to check in again, repeat.

From the user's point of view, a CVS check in either succeeds or requires that
the conflicts be resolved, after which another check in may be attempted.  If
we're somehow interrupted in the middle of the process, the fooCvsTmp.leo file
preserves the users work.

About a month ago, I posted a screed on how @thin was inadequate to address
my needs; that what I needed to collaborate on via version control was exactly
the essence of Leo's value: the multiple expressions of structure, which by
their nature must exist outside of @thin.  I said I was going to live the pain
to discover a modus vivendi.

Having done that, let me now say:

AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!

But the exercise has led me to a vision, which I will implement to the extent
my nonexistent spare time and paltry programming talents permit.

The essence of the pain is "conflicts", which become more  certain to occur
as the leo file encompases ever more related files.  As I work on a change to
the Linux configuration, my colleague works on a change to the Solaris configuration,
and one of us checks in our version of the leo file documenting the site
configuration first, and the other cannot check in his version of that file.
The conflict must be resolved by the human.  Using the "diff" tool on the .leo
XML is not an answer (though thank Heaven and Ed for gnxs).  The resolution
needs two levels of support: outline and node.

With the .leo file declared binary, in the event of a conflict CVS leaves you
with the most recent CVS version and your rejected version, and you're responsible
for performing a reconciliation and then resubmitting that.  Leo will recognize
the problem, and present both versions of the project, side by side, splitting
the outline pane.  The parallel trees will scroll/expand/contract in unison.
Outline branches present in CVS and not yours will display as blank space in
your version; nodes present in your version and not CVS will display as blank
space in the CVS version. The CVS version will be read only, your version editable.
The same node with differences in its text or in its children will be highlighted.
You will be able to drag nodes from the CVS version into your version. If the
text of a selected node has conflicts, the text area will split in two, showing
the CVS version and your version, with differences highlighted, both sides of
the pane scrolling in unison, the CVS side read-only, and you can copy from
that side to your side.  I intend to take as many ideas as I can from tkdiff
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdiff/ - see also
http://freshmeat.net/screenshots/10602/ ).  (I have begun translating tkdiff
from from tcl to python - nearly 9000 lines and I'm still learning both languages,
so draw your own timeline.)  You edit your nodes, you edit your tree, you hit
the "reconcile" button, and your reconciliation of the conflict goes into CVS.
If, meanwhile, another one of your over-achieving colleages has again updated
CVS, the process repeats with the most current CVS version.  Or you can hit
the "abandon" button to give up on your changes.

As the Hebrews say at Passover: "Next year in Jerusalem."

What is the intended behavior when foo.leo has a cloned node that appears several
times in a derived (or multiple derived files) and the user edits this file
or files to change two or more instances of the cloned node in different ways.

Example:

@file foo.py
****begin tnode
@others
****end tnode
...definition of procedure a
***begin tnode
def a:
...print "a:", <<bar>>
***end tnode
...<<bar>>
****begin tnode
"bar"
****end tnode

...definition of procedure b
***begin tnode
def b:
...print "b:", <<bar>>
***end tnode
...<<bar>>
****begin tnode
"bar"
****end tnode

...definition of procedure c
***begin tnode
def c:
...print "a:", <<bar>>
***end tnode
...<<bar>>
****begin tnode
"bar"
****end tnode

In the .leo, if I edit <<bar>>, it will change simultaneously in each place,
always in synch. However, suppose I edit foo.py in a text editor and change
foo.py to read:

#@verbatim
#@+leo
#@verbatim
#@+node:0::@file foo.py
#@verbatim
#@+body
#@verbatim
#@+others
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::definition of a
#@verbatim
#@+body
print "a:", 
#@verbatim
#@<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+body
"bar"
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:1::definition of a
#@verbatim
#@+node:2::definition of b
#@verbatim
#@+body
print "b:", 
#@verbatim
#@<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+body
"variation b"
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:2::definition of b
#@verbatim
#@+node:3::definition of c
#@verbatim
#@+body
print "c:", 
#@verbatim
#@<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+body
"variation c"
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:3::definition of c
#@verbatim
#@-others
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:0::@file foo.py
#@verbatim
#@-leo

Now what is supposed to happen when leo tries to read foo.py back in? It seems
that there are three possible behaviors:

1) leo reports a conflict that the user needs to resolve.
2) leo breaks the clone: the three nodes become separate vnodes, not clones
of the same one.
3) leo arbitrarily takes one of the tnodes to be the new tnode for all of the
clones. This is currently what happens. It creates something like a race condition,
where the last node in the derived file determines what the final result will
be. In this case, all three tnodes get text "variation c".

This general question of how Leo should deal with conflicts in clone nodes seems
to me that it needs to be addressed, particularly with respect to trying to
avoid cvs conflicts via thick/thin modes.

Note that this can become quite a subtle question because the same node can
be cloned across several different derived files, in which case a serious race
condition may pertain.

At the least, I would like to see leo perform consistency checking on cloned
nodes when it reads a derived file back in and warn the user if cloned nodes
are inconsistent.

Note that the issue also occurs with OpenWith: I can open each instance of a
cloned node as a separate file in the external text editor. Which version is
read back into leo depends on the order in which I save them from the external
editor.

 Possible solution   
2003-01-13 20:55  
One possible solution for the conflicting clones problem is to have Leo, when it detects a conflicting clone, generate a text file (perhaps named LeoConflict_NNNN.leo, where NNNN is the gid of the node in question), which contains all the different versions of the node in question, output in leo XML format. 

The vnode would then be marked with a "conflict" flag that would prevent the user from opening it in Leo until the conflict is resolved. See below for how the user resolves the conflict. 

What I have in mind is something similar to the CVS conflict file, where a conflict between two versions is marked 

<<<<<<< 
blah blah blah? 
======= 
blah blah blah! 
>>>>>>> 

Except that we would output this file in Leo XML format. The reason for XML format would be to avoid problems of how to generically delimit the different sections (different versions of the cloned node). Here leo's XML tags can unambiguously delimit the sections. 

The user would then edit the conflict file and delete all but the desired version. Then he would tell leo to resolve the conflict by reading the corrected file in and replacing the contents of the conflicting node with the contents of the LeoConflict_NNNN.leo file. 

On the down side, this may well be too baroque a fix for a problem that most users may never encounter. If so, perhaps it's best left alone until more pressing problems are solved. I know what I am doing with Leo and am always careful NOT to generate conflicting clones when I edit in an external text editor, so I don't absolutely need a resolution to this problem. I raised it because it's good for a program to have well-defined behavior when presented with anomalous input. 

In this sense, perhaps the best thing is to allow users to generate code from clones (what Allan Holub referred to as "enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot"), but to tell them that this practice is frowned upon.

Edward, now that conflicting clones may not be the result of bad style, I would
like to propose yet another solution that I have been thinking of for a while.

My basic approach is that cloning is not just a convenience tool, it may also
reflect some of the properties of the code/code set. Therefore my goal is for
clone links to remain even if they are conflicting, and let the user resolve
them at any convenient time. I also think that Leo's user interface is the best
tool to resolve such conflicts.

Thus here is my view of clone management and resolution inside Leo. Anytime
content is loaded into Leo, if a clone set agrees (i.e. have the same content)
all clone copies are marked "green". When one green clone is edited, all green
clones are changed. This is Leo as it is now.

If at some point conflicting clones are loaded, Leo decides on some representing
content (may be based on policies like most occurring content, or latest timestamp,
etc.) and provides visual clues for the conflict. The visual clue is give by
a double node box, e.g.

+---------------+
+ clone org +
+---------------+
+ resolution +
+---------------+

such that it is a single node in the tree, but has two content node, the original
text, and the possibly arbitrary resolution.

The resolution pseudo node is marked "blue", while the original text is either
"green", if it is identical to the blue node, or "red", if it is not. To emphasis,
the red/green nodes contain the specific (possibly) unique code associated with
the derived file, while the pseudo blue node contains the shared clone content.
During save to derived files, only the red/green content is saved, so effectively
the file is not changed and the conflict is not resolved until the user chooses
to do so. However, the clone relationship (via the gti) remains.

During editing, changes to red/green clones are local and do not propagate to
other clone copies (actually any change to a green node would turn it red).
Changes to the blue nodes do propagate since it is a single view of the clone.
A node pair may be converted to a regular node, effectively getting a new gti
and eliminating the blue copy. Or, it may be converted to the shared copy,
effectively forgetting its original content (leaving only the blue node). Once
there are no more red nodes in a clone set, all its nodes become green again
and the conflict is resolved.

Some additional clone actions I think are useful are:

1. Go to next/prev clone.
2. Go to next/prev green clone (useful when there are red ones).
3. Convert all green copies to a new clone group (useful when some clone copies
needs to remain clones, but break from the original clone set, thus getting
a new clone gti)

Action 3 enables the user to partition its clone set to several clone groups
by copying a clone's original content to its blue copy and finding matching
(green) clones.

What do we gain by all this?

1. We can have conflicting clones without catastrophes.
2. We get tools to handle conflicts and resolve them.
3. We keep on working is Leo's environment, which is the most supportive one
we can expect.

Gil

(By the way, I have a feeling that it would be useful to include along with
the gti a hash of its node content, which could tell Leo is a node was changed
outside of it. Also, including a timestamp in the opening sentinel, indicating
when Leo last saved it. These may help having intelligent decisions by Leo in
cases like conflicting clones.)

Another thing to think about is what should happen when close heading is changing.
Right now, if you are inside Leo, all headings will be changed, and if you try
to change by hand it in the derived file, clone links are removed (after some
error reporting). This is quite reasonable in the current scheme of things,
where one is not really expected to mess up with Leo sentinels.

However, if/when @include is implemented, one would probably edit some files
with clones that may extend to other files and changing the clone node name
(via Leo) is quite feasible. Note that the gti for the cloned node would probably
not change. So

1. Do Leo resync the clone content based on the gti?
2. Does it break cloning and allocates a new gti for one (arbitrary?) clone
set?
3. Let the user resolve manually, offer undoable auto-resolution with reporting,
other?

If I understand correctly, there are two different problems:

- Trailing whitespaces
- Left indented comments

1. Before commenting on these, a question:

If I write something like
    a=b
    if a:
        @others

[four spaces indentation]

I sometimes see tab characters before the lines inserted for '@others'.

It seems that Leo remembers 'two levels of indentation', and then
fabricates this indentation using tab characters.

I think it might be more robust if Leo remembered the actual
characters in front of @others and would use them for indentation.

I suspect that many indentation errors I had with Leo could have been
avoided had not Leo had its own ideas on how to do indentation.

Maybe Leo could use the exact sequence of characters in front of
@others for all inserted lines?

2. I do not care much about trailing whitespaces. Most of the time
they are invisible, but sometimes they are very misleading (trailing in python or C).

As far as I am concerned, Leo need never produce trailing whitespaces.

Maybe we need special machinery if sources have trailing whitespaces
and the sources are not under our control. 

Not sure if everybody would be happy if we essentially ban all trailing
whitespaces.

3. Unindented commentlines could be dealt with by using indentation to
indicate structure.

Of course, this might break the correspondance Leo structure / Python
structure, which is very ugly.

4. One possible alternative might be a new directive which indicates outindent:

@outindent <number>.

This would apply to the next comment block.

To me, 4. looks a little bit less ugly than 3.

5. As indicated in a different post, I suspect that Leo has a problem
if almost every node in an outline is changed. Profiling should point
to the culprit.

> 2. Have Leo strip whitespace from otherwise blank lines, and hope
that that solves all problems in Perfect Import. This is solving the
problem in the atFile code. The problem is that if we apply settings
in general we will get massive changes to derived files. In most
programming settings these changes might be welcome, but the problem
is actually making these changes. My first few attempts met with
abject failure.

Are you saying that you could not remove trailing blanks? What kind of
problems did you run into?

Summary:
- Use actual characters in front of @others or <<>> for indentation.
- Don't write trailing whitespaces
- Introduce directive for left-indendet comments.
- Profile to find out what slows Leo down if many nodes change.

*Many* calls to g.es and g.es_print have a mix of translated and untranslated items.
Untranslated items should include file names, directories, gnx's, leo_id's etc.

**Don't bother to do clone-find-all: there are 666 many matches!**

Regardless of the chosen scheme:

- g.translate will do the actual translation.

- Some simple string, like tr, will be an abbreviation for g.translate.
  The typical import will be::

    import leoGlobals as g ; tr = g.translate

The easiest scheme seems to be:

- g.es and g.es_print translate all arguments.

*** Important ***

The new code is just barely enough to open a window with a nullGui for @button dynamic-tests.
**However**, it is just the start of what would be required to open a window and execute most operations on it.
In particular, throughout leoEditCommands.py we should substitute c.frame.gui (or self.gui) for g.app.gui.
But it's way too late in the Leo 4.4.3 release cycle to do that.

This is just a nit I guess, but I move between two machines all the time, and
Leo keeps changing the paths I open from /home/tbrown/project/project.leo to
/media/hda8/project/project.leo, so that when I switch to the other machine,
where /home/tbrown/project/project.leo is actually /media/hdb2/project/project.leo,
the recent files link is wrong.

If it would be trivial for Leo to not do this, I'd like that feature.  If it's
a big deal, then not to worry, I can always navigate to the file of course.

After more thought I am ready to back off my earlier post. Positions are perfectly reasonable things to support. Indeed, they can be, and probably should be, coequal with iterators. 

My 'revulsion' to positions stems from their present implementation--the 'optimization' of positions to avoid adding items to p.stack is certainly the worst optimization presently in Leo. It dates from the days when I was obsessing about reducing the amount of positions created. That was a valid concern then, but Leo now does an excellent job of not generating excess positions. Thus, there is no reason not to have p.stack contain all the parent vnodes at the present spot in a traversal. 

The idea of representing a position by a count in a traversal is cute, but of no practical importance. Indeed, why should Leo be forced to stupidly step through an entire traversal when a list of vnodes in p.stack would get to the proper spot in exponentially shorter time. Moreover, a list of vnodes in p.stack is great information to have, while a count N is almost exactly useless :-) 

Still, it is good to emphasize that *any* position, no matter how it is represented, makes sense *only* for a particular outline, that is, for a particular set of vnodes. In short, positions will stay, but will be reimplemented for the graph world.

@nocolor

There will be some significant changes to the position and vnode classes for the graph world (Leo 4.5).  These changes will be common to both the graph and clone worlds:

Only vnode methods will be allowed to alter outline/graph data.  This would have been a good rule to following earlier, but up until now Leo has allowed 'confused' scripts--script that treat positions like vnodes.  This confusion will not be allowed in Leo 4.5.  The need for strict separation between vnodes and positions has become apparent in the recent chapters work.

It would be best to think of a position as a *path* to a particular vnode.  In the present (clone) world, the path is used exclusively by the tree drawing logic.  That logic tests whether the node being drawn matches (has the same position) as c.currentPosition.  In the graph world it probably makes sense to speak only of the current *vnode*, say v, so a position p is *a* current position if p.v == v.

The (renewed) focus on vnodes will be necessary.  For example, there will be no such things as p.back() or v._back in the graph world.  That is, a vnode v will have no *intrinsic* siblings.  Instead, siblings are relative to a parent: the order of vnodes in the parent.children links implicitly define sibling relationships, but a vnode v may have many 'parents', i.e. there may be many nodes that point to v.  We could speak of 'siblings with respect to a particular parent', but I suspect that will not be a particularly useful concept.  Rather, it will probably be more natural simply to define node relationships using iterators.  We shall see...

These routines change self to a new position "in place".
That is, these methods must _never_ call p.copy().

When moving to a nonexistent position, these routines simply set p.v = None,
leaving the p.stack unchanged. This allows the caller to "undo" the effect of
the invalid move by simply restoring the previous value of p.v.

These routines all return self on exit so the following kind of code will work:

How can the button bar be enlarged to take a second (or third!) row of icons? Or maybe the Scripting buttons can have

Vampire nodes from cvs

I've just discovered a major problem with cvs updates.  It is a subtle consequence of how Leo writes outlines and reads derived files.  This is a big bug in Leo, not cvs.  The effect of the bug is that nodes can appear in derived files that were never written to them!

The discovery of this 'big bug' came about as the result of the following Aha:

**@thin files that contain @all directives should be a cvs binary (-kb) files.**

The reason is straightforward:  cvs doesn't know enough to merge such files.  Maybe all @thin derived files should be -kb files, but Leo's users will never agree to that!

Anyway, leoProjects.txt is now a binary file as far as cvs is concerned.  Other .txt files, like leoScripts.txt, should also be binary files.  As we shall see, the fact that leoProjects.txt is now a -kb file means that we can not possibly blame the cvs merge algorithm for what is about to happen.

Ok, back to the 'big bug'.  Here is how I got bitten:

- I changed leoProjects.txt in two sandboxes 1 and 2.  In sandbox 1 I added a node called 'changed in the main line'.  In sandbox 2 I added a node called 'changed2'.

- I changed LeoPyRef.leo in sandbox 2, but *not* in sandbox 1.

- I did a update in sandbox 2.

As expected (now that leoProjects.txt is a binary file) I got the following from cvs:

M src/LeoPyRef.leo
...
cvs update: nonmergeable file needs merge
cvs update: revision 1.448 from repository is now in src/leoProjects.txt
cvs update: file from working directory is now in .#leoProjects.txt.1.447

To summarize the update:

- LeoPyRef.leo has been marked as modified (M), but it has **not** been changed by cvs.

- As expected, leoProjects.txt contains the version from sandbox **1**.

So far, so good.  But when I opened LeoPyRef.leo I got a huge surprise: the outline contains **both** the node 'changed in main-line' and the node 'changed2'.  Whoa Nellie!

How did this happen?  Well, obviously the 'changed in main-line' node came from the cvs update.  I expected that.  The 'changed2' line must have come from the local copy of LeoPyRef.leo.

Once I knew what to look for it wasn't too hard to discover what had happened.  The 'changed2' is a descendent of a cloned node called '4.4 projects'.

- One clone of '4.4 projects' node is a descendent of the @thin leoProjects.txt node.

- Another clone of the '4.4 project' is in the LeoPyRef.leo file but outside of any @thin node.

So the 'resurrection' of the 'changed2' node happened while Leo was reading leoProjects.txt into LeoPyRef.leo.  The '4.4 projects' node **already existed in the outline** before Leo read leoProjects.txt, and the present atFile read logic only **adds** nodes, it never deletes nodes.  Thus, the 'changed2' node 'survived' the atFile read logic.  The 'changed2' node became a 'vampire' node that couldn't be killed.

The problem is far from benign.  Because of clones, the vampire node became an orphan node in **another** file, namely leoKeys.py.  I tried two or three times to remove the vampire/orphan node before realizing what had happened.

The fix (there is *always* a fix) will require some care.  The present atFile.read logic is robust because it *doesn't* delete nodes.  It is essential that the read logic remain robust.  I suspect the solutions will be as follows:

A. The atFile.read code can not delete the subtree of @thin nodes initially, because it doesn't know whether there will be read errors later.  If there are read errors absolutely nothing must change.  This ensures that read errors never destroy information.

B. A new post-pass will look for vampire nodes: nodes that were not actually read from the derived file.  I think (but haven't proven) that all descendents of vampire nodes are also vampire nodes.  If that is so the post-pass will simply delete vampire nodes without worrying about whether they have descendents.

Warning: the new scheme will mean that cvs update can destroy information that previously existed in the outline.  I believe this is correct: we assume that derived files are the 'truly meaningful' files.  Hey, if we are wrong we can always get the old info from cvs :-)

I guess its hard to say what pieces must merge and what can stay different.
Id like it if the blasted nodes were the same.  I guess there is progress again
on a jython 2.2 being complete and work starting on 2.3.  So there is hope that
the nodes will be the same code, at least it will be possible.

At the top of my head the big differences outside of the position changes are:
1. Some modifications to the read/write code so that Chapters can work and also
Serialized positions.
2. Commander has some things different, it looks to the Chapters instance to
determine what is the curentPosition, top Position etc... instead of keeping
track of it itself.
3. GUI layers are very different.  Interesting tidbit here: the work I did to
get the JTree to use positions to determine if a node is expanded or not looks
like it has provided the outline for enhancing the JTree for Java itself to
be able to do this.  We will have to see, but maybe in Java 7 you can say: "Positions
lead to user controled tree expansion models".

There is a tremendous amount that is the same. Im sure you could make an interesting
evening out of comparing the codebases to see where things change.

To build your module using GCC is a three step process on Unix. (I have know
idea how many steps it is on Windows™.)

Start by running the Pyrex compiler over your code as follows, where
mymodule.pyx is the name of the Pyrex module you are writing. python2.2 pyrexc
mymodule.pyx Next, compile the resulting C file into a .o file. The call to gcc
looks like this:

gcc -c -fPIC -I/usr/include/python2.2/ mymodule.c
The arguments to gcc are explained below.

-c 
Produces a .o file instead of an executable. 
-fPIC 
Produces position independent code, so we can dynamically link against it later. 
-I/usr/include/python2.2/ 
is the location of the Python 2.2 include file. The location of your Python include file may differ from /usr/include/python2.2/. 
mymodule.c 
is the name of the C file produced by Pyrex. 
Finally, link the .o into a .so: gcc -shared mymodule.o -lxosd -o mymodule.so
-shared 
produces a shared-object file, instead of an executable. 
mymodule.o 
is the name of the module you wish to compile. 
-lxosd 
links against a C-library, with the name of the library given as the argument. 
-o mymodule.so 
causes gcc to put the output into a file called mymodule.so 
The C library that you are wrapping will probably differ from mymodule.

The pyrexc command supports the following options:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -v    --version                     Display version number of pyrex compiler

                                       one source file allowed if this is used)

Anything else is taken as the name of a Pyrex source file and compiled
to a C source file. Multiple Pyrex source files can be specified
(unless -o is used), in which case each source file is treated as the
source of a distinct extension module and compiled separately to
produce its own C file.

The problem is that autocompletion depends on state: self.leadinWord,
prevObjects, etc. Thus, it's not presently possible to start the proces
anywhere. Similar remarks apply to calltips, which relies on autocompleter
state.

This is a complex problem, and not very serious now that there is an easy way of
