System requirements for leo.py
------------------------------

leo.py requires Python 2.2.1 or above and tcl/tk 8.4 or above.

	Download Python from http://python.org/ 
	Download tcl/Tk from http://tcl.activestate.com/software/tcltk/

Warning: When building Tcl on Linux, do not specify "--enable-threads" .
Only use Tcl with the default "threads not enabled" case.
Installing the leo.py on Linux
------------------------------

You can install Leo using the install script provided.  Remember to 'chmod +x' before running this script.

Leo is distributed as a single compressed (.zip) folder.  Simply uncompress this folder, put the folder in a convenient place and run leo.py.  You can run leo.py by double-clicking leo.py.  You can also run leo.py from a Python interpreter as follows:

	import leo
	leo.run() # runs leo.py, opening a new outline.
	leo.go() # runs leo.py after reloading all modules.
	leo.leoOpen(fileName) # runs leo.py, reloads all modules, and opens fileName.

You may specify options using the configuration file called leoSettings.leo.
Installing the leo.py on Windows
--------------------------------

Important: You can install leo.py on Windows using the single-click installer called leosetup.exe.

Leo is distributed as a single compressed (.zip) folder.  Uncompress this folder, put the folder in a convenient place and run leo.py.  You can run leo.py by double-clicking leo.py.  You can also run leo.py from a Python interpreter as follows:

	import leo
	leo.run() # runs leo.py, opening a new outline.
	leo.go() # runs leo.py after reloading all modules.
	leo.leoOpen(fileName) # runs leo.py, reloads all modules, and opens fileName.

You may specify options using the configuration file called leoSettings.leo.

Installing leo.py on MacOs
--------------------------

Leo works reliably only on MacOS X 10.3 (Panther).

To run Leo on Macintosh OS X 10.3:

1) Download and install "MacPython 2.3 for Panther addons".

Python is already included in OS X 10.3 so only the addons are necessary

	http://www.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython.html

2) Download and install TclTkAqua.

	http://tcltkaqua.sourceforge.net/

3) Run the PackageManager found in /Applications/MacPython-2.3 and  
install "_tkinter-2.3-binary" by clicking on the package in the list  
and clicking the [Install:] button with "Install dependencies" checked

4)  Install Leo.  There are two ways to do this.

a)  The NEW way: Download Leo-version-number.pkg from

    http://leo.sourceforge.net/

Double-click Leo.pkg to install the Leo folder. I recommend that you install Leo
in your home directory.

b) The OLD way: Download Leo-version-number.zip:

	http://leo.sourceforge.net/

Unzip the contents into the desired directory by double-clicking the downloaded file.

5) Run Leo by ontrol-clicking on /path_to_unzipped_dir/leo/src/leo.py and open
with PythonLauncher.

6) It is a good idea to set PythonLauncher as the default program to  
open python scripts by clicking on "leo.py", choosing Get Info from the  
Finder's File menu, and selecting "PythonLauncher" as the default  
program to "Open With:"

By clicking the "Change All..." button, all python scripts will be  
opened with PythonLauncher.

8) (optional) Download and install Pmw. (Leo now contains Pmw in the extensions folder).

    http://pmw.sourceforge.net/

Pmw must be installed in order to use the Settings panel.

Drag the downloaded gzip file into
 
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages

Double click on it to unzip and untar the file into a folder to make it
available to Python

Thanks to Randall Voth for these instructions.
Using shell scripts and batch files to make using Leo easier
------------------------------------------------------------

On Linux, the following shell script will allow you to open foo.leo files by typing leo foo

#!/bin/sh 
python <leopath>/leo.py $1

where <leopath> is replaced with the path to the leo directory. 

On Windows, the equivalent batch file would be:

c:\python22\python <leopath>leo.py %1
