http://zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage/guide/node2.html#SECTION000210000000000000000

1.1 What is the ZODB?

The ZODB is a persistence system for Python objects. Persistent programming
languages provide facilities that automatically write objects to disk and read
them in again when they're required by a running program. By installing the
ZODB, you add such facilities to Python.

#@-node:ekr.20041002151816.1:What is the ZODB?
#@+node:ekr.20041002151816.2:How ZODB Works
2.2 How ZODB Works

The ZODB is conceptually simple. Python classes subclass a persistent.Persistent
class to become ZODB-aware. Instances of persistent objects are brought in from
a permanent storage medium, such as a disk file, when the program needs them,
and remain cached in RAM. The ZODB traps modifications to objects, so that when
a statement such as obj.size = 1 is executed, the modified object is marked as
``dirty.'' On request, any dirty objects are written out to permanent storage;
this is called committing a transaction. Transactions can also be aborted or
rolled back, which results in any changes being discarded, dirty objects
reverting to their initial state before the transaction began.

#@-node:ekr.20041002151816.2:How ZODB Works
#@+node:ekr.20041002151816.3:Rules for Writing Persistent Classes
2.6 Rules for Writing Persistent Classes

Practically all persistent languages impose some restrictions on programming
style, warning against constructs they can't handle or adding subtle semantic
changes, and the ZODB is no exception. Happily, the ZODB's restrictions are
fairly simple to understand, and in practice it isn't too painful to work around
them.

The summary of rules is as follows:

* If you modify a mutable object that's the value of an object's attribute, the
ZODB can't catch that, and won't mark the object as dirty. The solution is to
either set the dirty bit yourself when you modify mutable objects, or use a
wrapper for Python's lists and dictionaries (PersistentList, PersistentMapping)
that will set the dirty bit properly.

* Recent versions of the ZODB allow writing a class with __setattr__ ,
__getattr__, or __delattr__ methods. (Older versions didn't support this at
all.) If you write such a __setattr__ or __delattr__ method, its code has to set
the dirty bit manually.

* A persistent class should not have an __del__ method. The database moves
objects freely between memory and storage. If an object has not been used in a
while, it may be released and its contents loaded from storage the next time it
is used. Since the Python interpreter is unaware of persistence, it would call
the __del__ each time the object was freed.

Outlook: server for email, addresses & calendar.  Groupware.  Chandler similar.

Zope: back end is ZODB.  Zope like an OS: run Python code on Zope.

Zope: another way to access Leo files.  Maybe twisted is better?

Wiki anology: edit Leo files with browser.  Write through the web.

longrun.org

Wiki principles: 
	- Sharing is 90% of collaboration.
	- Zope: Subscribe to a wiki: email when page changes.
	- RSS: xml that defines piece of info(tile,url,abstract)
		- Client has a list of rss feeds: an xml file.
		- List of intesting people: notified when they say something.

Two goals:
	- publish Leo files
	- edit Leo files

Brother needs cvs.
Kent not so worried about cvs.
	-Leo file is a web site!
	- Helper layer between user and OS.
		- Look at aap project.  Author of vim. a-p.org
			- Replacement for make in Python.  Automating tool.
		- Expert prepares Leo file.  User uses it.

http://www.librelogiciel.com/software/

ZShell : Manipulate the Zope Object DataBase with Unix shell like commands

and also

ZShellScripts : Unifies the Zope notion of Scripts and provides several Script interpreters : Python, Unix shell , Lisp, Perl, PHP, Ruby, and Zope ZShell

Not only for obvious usefullness, but also as a valuable study of Python access to the ZODB.

JAXML is cool too..

z2.py,
>Supposing that that I did find this file, what would I be looking for? 

This is the Main script, the principal program, the code that startup all the
servers, the only python program that make run Zope, it the code called by start.py,
and it is the one to which you pass the command lines.

With the command line you can indicate which services to start up at which ports.
This is IMPORTANT. Also you can enable/disable the Debug mode.

python z2.py --help will give you some infos about what I'm talking about.

In linux the debug or not debug mode, enable the console or daemon mode (that
means 'background task mode').

In windows, I'm not sure that disabling the debug mode will be enough.
I know that at the install time you can setup Zope as a Windows Service, so
it will start automatically every time Windows Startup, and it will not open
a console window.

But first look at the debug mode.

Start.bat give some defaults command lines to z2.py

Webdav,
>What issues are involved in this choice, and why should I care today? 

from www.webdav.org

What is WebDAV? 
Briefly: WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning".
It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively
edit and manage files on remote web servers.

For example that means that you can open you Windows Explorer (from your mail
I understand that you work on an MsWindows OS),
tip the url "localhost:%i"%(your webdav port) and you will be able to navigate,
view and edit the Zope Objects just as a normal file system (well, almost).

WebDav is a standard and there are Python implementations. WebDav is support
by  Oscom.

WebDav is cool.
WebDav is the 'highest level tool'.

ZODB,

>Does that mean that gnx's aren't needed with Zope? Could Leo nodes live in
the ZODB?

You have to thinks to ZODB just as what it is: a Persistent Object Database.
Most objects in Zope are Persistents, that mean that their instances do not
die when you shutdown the server.

The ZODB store his data in it own format.
I think that GNX should be keeped.
You have to basic ways to put nodes into Zope.

First: the hard way: create a new Product (Products are something like Zope
plugins) that is based on the Leo code, but were there is no node storage, instead
the node should be Persistents. Then add rendering code to this objects.

Leo node object + Persistence + ZClass + Rendering Code -> Leo Zope node.

Additionaly you should create an Folder like object that should be an 'Leo Outline
Zope Object',  actuating as an Leo nodes container.

This shema is similar to the Zwiki way, with a Zwiki Web and the Zwiki Pages.

Second: Use A zope folder just as Leo manage the @file nodes. Let have simple
DTMLDocuments, edited via WebDav, with <dtml-comments> , and stuff like that.
The Leo import/export that nodes.

Edward,

I don't see ZLeo replacing Leo, rather a method of accessing
Leo files.

When I write, I almost always want it to be web accessable,
so that I can access it from any browser, and so that I can
share it easily. I would like myfile.leo to live
at http://longrun.org/leo/myfile.leo. It can be read and
written to from any browser (according to how permissions are
configured) The page describing how to configure Apache would
be found at http://longrun.org/leo/myfile.leo/Apache/configure
The only requirement to work with Leo files is a browser.

I wouldn't want to lose the capability to edit outside
the browser, using a standalone version of Leo or Zope's
ExternalEditor product. ExternalEditor allows me to click
an icon to open the page I'm viewing in any editor. I could
open it in Leo as a Leo file, or open just the page in
Vim (http://vim.sourceforge.net/index.php)

Zope is ponderous, I think of it as more of a platform
than an application. My understanding of how Zope works
grows slowly, in the mean time my focus is on _products_.
Installing a product in Zope is like installing an application
in Windows or Linux.

One of the most evolved products is Plone/CMF http://plone.org
which is basically a turnkey web site.

twisted http://twistedmatrix.com is a brilliant set of network
programming tools. That's all I know about it.

I'm not sure about Chandler (http://www.osafoundation.org/) 
(they did choose Python and ZODB http://www.osafoundation.org/technology.htm)

You might try subscribing to a Zope mailing list or two
http://www.zope.org/Resources/MailingLists
The community of users and developers is very important to Zope.

Thanks,
Kent

If zope is running some server then this server will be accesible from your
network if and only if there is no firewall in the way.

The people can access to your services using (normally on internet you do not
have a domain name)

your_ip:the_service_port

Example:
zope http service on port 8080 on your machine.
When  you connect to internet your machine got an extra IP.
Then simple put on the web browser

http://your_conexion_ip:8080

and Tada you will see the root_zope/index_html object rendered intro HTML.

Most of the ISP give you a dinamic IP.
Some companies provides you dinamic IP Domain Name services, allowing to attach
a domain name to your machine dinamically (each time you reconect).

then you can have:

http://leo.edward.com:8080/

The 8080 stuff can be avoied if you setup zope to use the standard port 80 for
HTTP service.

With this in mind you can access ftp

ftp://your_ip_or_domain_name:8021

or webdav, or anything else.

I would made a warning.

Zope IT IS NOT the only way to obtain an local HTTP server, pythonic and
flexible.

There is a lot of other way.

Also Zope IT IS NOT THE BEST pythonic http/ftp/webdav or anything server
aviable.

I think that we should define better 

What we want to do?

before choosing the tool.

As I said, I had already used Zope, I choosed it because of very specific features,
but nothing indicate that Zope is the best way to get Leo to the colaborative
network universe.

I think that we should at least consider:
- SimpleHTTPServer
- To take of the Medusa Server from Zope (that is use Zope code in the standard
Leo distribution, avoying dependences)
- Twisted matrix (I had no experience with it, but it looks much more
flexible/powerfull)

Zope provides you a specific framework, you have to match you application to
this framework, Zope (in my opinion) it is not a tool, it's an ambient.

It's seems that Edward it is new in the web oriented software, I think it has
a lot of potencialities and it will benefits Leo devellopment.

Please Edward, look at Zope as an example but not as THE options. Think about
what can be done, what should be done, and then we will take the best tool.

Anyway my opinion:
- SimpleHTTP server: usefull, it is in python, not very eficiente, just http
server	
- Medusa: usefull, very eficiente, just http server...
- Twisted Matrix: very powerfull, fresh comunity, confusing documentation, a
new paradigm, a devellopment tool.
- Zope: powerfull, eficient, comes with battery included, bad documentation,
to very paradigm oriented, the apps have to fit the paradigm, don't believe
all the promises, strong enthousiast comunity, poor web examples.

By: bwmulder

Since no one else answered this question, let me take a first take on the
question:

If you are connected to the internet, people can use your IP number to connect
to your computer. This IP number is often given dynamically, though some DSL
providers give you fixed IP numbers for an additional fee. If you did not ask
for fixed IP numbers, you probably have an dynamic IP number (I think).

An IP number consist of four digits. A connection to the (example) IP number
111.222.333.444 can by made via the request http://111.222.333.444

If you have a dynamic IP number, and your Internet provider provides you with
some space to publish HTML, you could, via a script, upload your current IP
number dynamically.

You might also consider buying a domain name. In this case, people can use the
domain name to connect to your computer instead of the IP number.

Another consideration are firewalls. Normally, you want a firewall isolating
your computer from attacks from the Internet. I firewall can be some additional
software. I am currently using a router, a piece of hardware, as a firewall.
Windows XP has firewall software build in. You might have to configure your
firewall to let requests for your server go through.

Finally, you might want to check the agreement you entered with your Internet
service provider, if you are allowed to run a server from your connection. It
might become a problem if your server becomes very popular.

What I see Zope offering is an alternative way of storing and retrieving nodes.
What you also get for "free" with Zope is concurrent access, security,
http/ftp/webdav access to the same node information etc. The hidden price you
pay is that Zope is big and many users will have other tools which can provide
these facilities also.

So, my thinking is that we can abstract the basic idea (alternative ways of
storing and retrieving node information) into Leo and then let the magic really
happen in the concrete implementation stage.

What does this mean? Well, we could change Leo so that whenever it goes to retrieve
Headline or Body it goes to a Node Server object to do that. The Node Server
object uses whatever method it wants to retrieve or set the information. The
Node server would also be responsible for telling Leo what child nodes an object
has and whether they are clones or not.

The cool part is that we could implement different kinds of Node server to talk
to different back-ends. These can then be thought of as drivers. So we might
have,

- a file system driver where all information is stored in files and directories
- a database driver where the DB stores all information
- an ftp driver
- a Zope driver
- the default Leo driver

People could write a driver to their own back end storage system. 

What is the advantage of this?

Well, the magic really happens in the back-end. If you choose a back end which
supports versioning, security, concurrent working, web access, etc etc then
Leo now supports them. If you choose a back-end which supports dynamic mark-up
or some other fancy stuff then Leo supports it. The key is that Leo doesn't
need to bind itself to any one system to achieve this - the end user can install
the relevant driver, configure the back-end and just go with it.

Ok, I'll have a bash in a rough order or when things occurred...


1. Everything is web based. I had the same problem you did. I ran the
thing and said, "ok, so what did it do". Others have pointed you in the
right direction now with visiting http://localhost:8080 and
http://localhost:8080/manage to view the site and mange it respectively.

If you are running WinNT, 2000 or XP you can also run Zope as a service,
which is much more convenient as you don't need the console window open
all the time.


2. Everything in Zope is an object. Ok, you'll see this a lot. The best
thing to do is think "wow, cool" and then forget it again as you
probably wont really see how this helps at all until you get much deeper
into Zope. 


3. DTML allows you to construct web pages by piecing together bits much
like writing a program from functions. In fact you will find DTML is a
lot like tangling Leo's @root nodes. Here's a bit...

<!-- start html -->

<h>DTML allows you to assemble web pages much like Leo tangles
documents</h>

<p>For instance, have a look at how this page is constructed</p>

<dtml-var first_bit>
<dtml-var second_bit>
<dtml-var third_bit>

<!-- end html -->

The <dtml-var name> bit is like a < < name > > directive. It effectively
inserts the object (could be HTML, an image or something more complex)
in the current page. 

To see this snippet in action you can visit my server at
http://24.243.129.68:8080/members/sandbox/index_html

To see the code, visit http://24.243.129.68:8080/members/sandbox/manage
(username=edream, pwd=leo) and then click on the index_html to see the
main DTML. Feel free to mess around in here but please don't publish the
IP address as my ISP doesn't allow servers!


4. There is a lot of power in Zope products. Try going to www.zope.org
and seeing what is available. As an example I put a Wiki in the sandbox
area http://24.243.129.68:8080/members/sandbox/edswiki


5. If you are looking for a good book to begin with then steer clear of
"The Zope Book"! If you don't mind paying then "The book of Zope" is a
much better introduction. When you have read this then "The Zope Book"
will make some sense but really I found this book tremendously hard to
get through.


6. Web standards are very cool! Zope supports FTP. Point your favourite
FTP tool to,

ftp://24.243.129.68:8021/members/sandbox/

Or try using WebDav by creating a network place pointing to

http://24.243.129.68:8080/members/sandbox

You can then use windows explorer or an ftp tool to browse your objects.


7. Everything is an object! I can't do justice to the concept of
Acquisition here but by the time you have messed around with Zope a bit
you should start to see how acquisition starts to make things really
work like classes in Python. 


I realize this isn't very coherent - if I get a spare moment this
weekend I'll knock up a quick demo showing Leo interacting with Zope.

Paul

If leo use database storage (ZODB or otherwise)
it could scale much better. This will bring us some
possiblity to store all versions of changes to a node
or a tree.

Cloning will then point to a specific version. If there
is no conflict, it can update to a later version when
the primary clone change. If there is a conflict
we can deal with it wisely using 'diff information'
because we have 'all versions' stored.

Subject: Enhancement request: Make Leo deal with a database

It would be Way Cool if Leo could deal with psycopg or other DataBase 
API compliant implementations and fetch and store database records.

Details of what I'd like to see:

I'm working on Python source code. I want Leo to pull a source code file 
from a database record built something like this:

filename: text
updated: datetimestamp
code: text

Leo would insert a new record, not update an existing one, each time a 
Save was done, with a more current time stamp.  

When a File Open was requested (i.e. a node on a existing Leo outline 
was being pulled from a database), Leo would fetch the most recent 
time-stamped version only.

I use this same technique for my wiki pages.  It's very easy to 
implement in SQL and works great.

Leo would also need the ability to save the same file to a regular 
python source code file on disk at a specific location, so you'd have 
to be able to put more than one save/load directive in a given node.

This would provide a nice version history and could lead to other Useful 
Things in Leo.

There have been a couple different suggestions on how to obtain a .leo file
that presents the conflicts for resolution.  My initial thought was to have
some sort of external file containing only the structure information of interest.
Edward has suggested that we could process the CVS created .leo file with all
its conflict indicators.

I'd like to offer another alternative: based on the ad-hoc procedure that Edward
is currently using, i.e.,

* Save your work to foo.leo file.
* copy your foo.leo file to fooCvsTmp.leo
* cvs ci
* if there are no conflicts (hurray)
*    remove fooCvsTmp.leo; finished
* otherwise
*    remove foo.leo
*    cvs up foo.leo
*    read foo.leo into an internal directed acyclic graph (DAG)
*    generate the conflict resolution DAG from the proposed new leo internal
DAG (which Leo already has as a matter of course) and the CVS derived DAG
*    present for editting
*    when you are satisfied and want to try to check in again, repeat.

From the user's point of view, a CVS check in either succeeds or requires that
the conflicts be resolved, after which another check in may be attempted.  If
we're somehow interrupted in the middle of the process, the fooCvsTmp.leo file
preserves the users work.

About a month ago, I posted a screed on how @thin was inadequate to address
my needs; that what I needed to collaborate on via version control was exactly
the essence of Leo's value: the multiple expressions of structure, which by
their nature must exist outside of @thin.  I said I was going to live the pain
to discover a modus vivendi.

Having done that, let me now say:

AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!

But the exercise has led me to a vision, which I will implement to the extent
my nonexistent spare time and paltry programming talents permit.

The essence of the pain is "conflicts", which become more  certain to occur
as the leo file encompases ever more related files.  As I work on a change to
the Linux configuration, my colleague works on a change to the Solaris configuration,
and one of us checks in our version of the leo file documenting the site
configuration first, and the other cannot check in his version of that file.
The conflict must be resolved by the human.  Using the "diff" tool on the .leo
XML is not an answer (though thank Heaven and Ed for gnxs).  The resolution
needs two levels of support: outline and node.

With the .leo file declared binary, in the event of a conflict CVS leaves you
with the most recent CVS version and your rejected version, and you're responsible
for performing a reconciliation and then resubmitting that.  Leo will recognize
the problem, and present both versions of the project, side by side, splitting
the outline pane.  The parallel trees will scroll/expand/contract in unison.
Outline branches present in CVS and not yours will display as blank space in
your version; nodes present in your version and not CVS will display as blank
space in the CVS version. The CVS version will be read only, your version editable.
The same node with differences in its text or in its children will be highlighted.
You will be able to drag nodes from the CVS version into your version. If the
text of a selected node has conflicts, the text area will split in two, showing
the CVS version and your version, with differences highlighted, both sides of
the pane scrolling in unison, the CVS side read-only, and you can copy from
that side to your side.  I intend to take as many ideas as I can from tkdiff
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdiff/ - see also
http://freshmeat.net/screenshots/10602/ ).  (I have begun translating tkdiff
from from tcl to python - nearly 9000 lines and I'm still learning both languages,
so draw your own timeline.)  You edit your nodes, you edit your tree, you hit
the "reconcile" button, and your reconciliation of the conflict goes into CVS.
If, meanwhile, another one of your over-achieving colleages has again updated
CVS, the process repeats with the most current CVS version.  Or you can hit
the "abandon" button to give up on your changes.

As the Hebrews say at Passover: "Next year in Jerusalem."

What is the intended behavior when foo.leo has a cloned node that appears several
times in a derived (or multiple derived files) and the user edits this file
or files to change two or more instances of the cloned node in different ways.

Example:

@file foo.py
****begin tnode
@others
****end tnode
...definition of procedure a
***begin tnode
def a:
...print "a:", <<bar>>
***end tnode
...<<bar>>
****begin tnode
"bar"
****end tnode

...definition of procedure b
***begin tnode
def b:
...print "b:", <<bar>>
***end tnode
...<<bar>>
****begin tnode
"bar"
****end tnode

...definition of procedure c
***begin tnode
def c:
...print "a:", <<bar>>
***end tnode
...<<bar>>
****begin tnode
"bar"
****end tnode

In the .leo, if I edit <<bar>>, it will change simultaneously in each place,
always in synch. However, suppose I edit foo.py in a text editor and change
foo.py to read:

#@verbatim
#@+leo
#@verbatim
#@+node:0::@file foo.py
#@verbatim
#@+body
#@verbatim
#@+others
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::definition of a
#@verbatim
#@+body
print "a:", 
#@verbatim
#@<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+body
"bar"
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim

#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:1::definition of a
#@verbatim
#@+node:2::definition of b
#@verbatim
#@+body
print "b:", 
#@verbatim
#@<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+body
"variation b"
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:2::definition of b
#@verbatim
#@+node:3::definition of c
#@verbatim
#@+body
print "c:", 
#@verbatim
#@<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@+body
"variation c"
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:1::<<bar>>
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:3::definition of c
#@verbatim
#@-others
#@verbatim
#@-body
#@verbatim
#@-node:0::@file foo.py
#@verbatim
#@-leo

Now what is supposed to happen when leo tries to read foo.py back in? It seems
that there are three possible behaviors:

1) leo reports a conflict that the user needs to resolve.
2) leo breaks the clone: the three nodes become separate vnodes, not clones
of the same one.
3) leo arbitrarily takes one of the tnodes to be the new tnode for all of the
clones. This is currently what happens. It creates something like a race condition,
where the last node in the derived file determines what the final result will
be. In this case, all three tnodes get text "variation c".

This general question of how Leo should deal with conflicts in clone nodes seems
to me that it needs to be addressed, particularly with respect to trying to
avoid cvs conflicts via thick/thin modes.

Note that this can become quite a subtle question because the same node can
be cloned across several different derived files, in which case a serious race
condition may pertain.

At the least, I would like to see leo perform consistency checking on cloned
nodes when it reads a derived file back in and warn the user if cloned nodes
are inconsistent.

Note that the issue also occurs with OpenWith: I can open each instance of a
cloned node as a separate file in the external text editor. Which version is
read back into leo depends on the order in which I save them from the external
editor.

 Possible solution   
2003-01-13 20:55  
One possible solution for the conflicting clones problem is to have Leo, when it detects a conflicting clone, generate a text file (perhaps named LeoConflict_NNNN.leo, where NNNN is the gid of the node in question), which contains all the different versions of the node in question, output in leo XML format. 

The vnode would then be marked with a "conflict" flag that would prevent the user from opening it in Leo until the conflict is resolved. See below for how the user resolves the conflict. 

What I have in mind is something similar to the CVS conflict file, where a conflict between two versions is marked 

<<<<<<< 
blah blah blah? 
======= 
blah blah blah! 
>>>>>>> 

Except that we would output this file in Leo XML format. The reason for XML format would be to avoid problems of how to generically delimit the different sections (different versions of the cloned node). Here leo's XML tags can unambiguously delimit the sections. 

The user would then edit the conflict file and delete all but the desired version. Then he would tell leo to resolve the conflict by reading the corrected file in and replacing the contents of the conflicting node with the contents of the LeoConflict_NNNN.leo file. 

On the down side, this may well be too baroque a fix for a problem that most users may never encounter. If so, perhaps it's best left alone until more pressing problems are solved. I know what I am doing with Leo and am always careful NOT to generate conflicting clones when I edit in an external text editor, so I don't absolutely need a resolution to this problem. I raised it because it's good for a program to have well-defined behavior when presented with anomalous input. 

In this sense, perhaps the best thing is to allow users to generate code from clones (what Allan Holub referred to as "enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot"), but to tell them that this practice is frowned upon.

Edward, now that conflicting clones may not be the result of bad style, I would
like to propose yet another solution that I have been thinking of for a while.

My basic approach is that cloning is not just a convenience tool, it may also
reflect some of the properties of the code/code set. Therefore my goal is for
clone links to remain even if they are conflicting, and let the user resolve
them at any convenient time. I also think that Leo's user interface is the best
tool to resolve such conflicts.

Thus here is my view of clone management and resolution inside Leo. Anytime
content is loaded into Leo, if a clone set agrees (i.e. have the same content)
all clone copies are marked "green". When one green clone is edited, all green
clones are changed. This is Leo as it is now.

If at some point conflicting clones are loaded, Leo decides on some representing
content (may be based on policies like most occurring content, or latest timestamp,
etc.) and provides visual clues for the conflict. The visual clue is give by
a double node box, e.g.

+---------------+
+ clone org +
+---------------+
+ resolution +
+---------------+

such that it is a single node in the tree, but has two content node, the original
text, and the possibly arbitrary resolution.

The resolution pseudo node is marked "blue", while the original text is either
"green", if it is identical to the blue node, or "red", if it is not. To emphasis,
the red/green nodes contain the specific (possibly) unique code associated with
the derived file, while the pseudo blue node contains the shared clone content.
During save to derived files, only the red/green content is saved, so effectively
the file is not changed and the conflict is not resolved until the user chooses
to do so. However, the clone relationship (via the gti) remains.

During editing, changes to red/green clones are local and do not propagate to
other clone copies (actually any change to a green node would turn it red).
Changes to the blue nodes do propagate since it is a single view of the clone.
A node pair may be converted to a regular node, effectively getting a new gti
and eliminating the blue copy. Or, it may be converted to the shared copy,
effectively forgetting its original content (leaving only the blue node). Once
there are no more red nodes in a clone set, all its nodes become green again
and the conflict is resolved.

Some additional clone actions I think are useful are:

1. Go to next/prev clone.
2. Go to next/prev green clone (useful when there are red ones).
3. Convert all green copies to a new clone group (useful when some clone copies
needs to remain clones, but break from the original clone set, thus getting
a new clone gti)

Action 3 enables the user to partition its clone set to several clone groups
by copying a clone's original content to its blue copy and finding matching
(green) clones.

What do we gain by all this?

1. We can have conflicting clones without catastrophes.
2. We get tools to handle conflicts and resolve them.
3. We keep on working is Leo's environment, which is the most supportive one
we can expect.

Gil

(By the way, I have a feeling that it would be useful to include along with
the gti a hash of its node content, which could tell Leo is a node was changed
outside of it. Also, including a timestamp in the opening sentinel, indicating
when Leo last saved it. These may help having intelligent decisions by Leo in
cases like conflicting clones.)

Another thing to think about is what should happen when close heading is changing.
Right now, if you are inside Leo, all headings will be changed, and if you try
to change by hand it in the derived file, clone links are removed (after some
error reporting). This is quite reasonable in the current scheme of things,
where one is not really expected to mess up with Leo sentinels.

However, if/when @include is implemented, one would probably edit some files
with clones that may extend to other files and changing the clone node name
(via Leo) is quite feasible. Note that the gti for the cloned node would probably
not change. So

1. Do Leo resync the clone content based on the gti?
2. Does it break cloning and allocates a new gti for one (arbitrary?) clone
set?
3. Let the user resolve manually, offer undoable auto-resolution with reporting,
other?

More things to think about.

@ Tk will add a newline only if:
1. A real change has been made to the Tk.Text widget, and
2. the change did _not_ result in the widget already containing a newline.

It's not possible to tell, given the information available, what Tk has actually
done. We need only make a reasonable guess here. setUndoTypingParams stores the
number of trailing newlines in each undo bead, so whatever we do here can be
faithfully undone and redone.

Good point. I'll add a run-unit-test command soon.

It goes to sys.stderr, iirc.  Perhaps run-unit-test should support this setting:

I thought this might be for 4.4a2, but I see the same effect w/ 
Leo 4.3.3, build  1.282 , September 17, 2005
Python 2.3.5, Tk 8.4.7, win32

I haven't used Leo for code, but just started to try to re-organize some Perl
I inherited.

Leo apears to remove sentinels, AND preceding newlines, so the effect is something
like this:

.... some code....

   next line;
}
#@verbatim
#@ leo sentinel here...
#

    If  ( something ) {
      more code;
......

becomes:

.... some code....

   next line;
} If  ( something ) {
      more code;
......

Now, that may be annoying, but mildly so - it still runs.
When this:

#
#@verbatim
#@ sentinel
if () {

turns to this:

# if() {

code just breaks.

Leo can't represent some files using nodes!

I call this the "underindented blank line" problem.

Example:

@color

class aClass:
    def spam(): pass
# comment line
    def eggs(): pass
    
@nocolor

Leo's import code can't handle this:
    
- If the import code puts the comment line in a node, the line won't be output with the proper indentation!!

- Having the comment line stop the scanning of aClass is even worse.

- This usually shows up with an unindented blank line instead of the comment line.

Howdy,

I'm executing a script in a Leo node which has
an indentation error. I get the following report,
which doesn't help locate the error.

Pardon me if this is well known issue, I don't
remember discussion of it.

Thanks,

@nocolor
http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3505544
By: nobody

this topic deserves another thread, rather 
than hijack the IPython one in the main forum.

presently Leo has a few options documented,
--script has a required parameter filename
batch mode also requires a filename.
why are they not documented in the same place?
why is batch mode option called --script?
is it too late to change to --batch ?

filenames in windows that have spaces will 
have to be quoted if they follow an option.
otherwise there will be no telling the filename
after a --script from a possibly 'file name.leo'

luckily, there was no need to force everyone 
on windows to quote leo names or use -fsome.leo,
especially when other options aren't used.
a little tricky, but I think it works.

the --script could as well load the leo itself
for that matter maybe all the args after --script 
should be assumed to be part of the scripts options
and Leo should only process up to the --script fname.
maybe there can be another option to collect
options for the script to batch process.
not necessary to decide now.

optparse can verify option parameters 
with callbacks. like does a filename exist,
is there enough free diskspace etc etc.
and provide a standard usage menu on exit.
rather than a roll your own wherever it happens.
I am not familiar enough with Leo startup to say
how is the best way to verify filenames or to
pass the filenames to run or set ivars.
import leoGlobals as I have might not be possible
this early in startup. need to get version info too.

leo -script whatever.py  error or not? typo? fixable?
leo --script whatever.py is ['script', 'whatever.py'] 
coming up with a comprehensive set of input args and
expected outcomes will be necessary for testing.
I'll do that next.

what about encoding problems, should check optparse archive.
what about py2.2 using optparse from 2.4? trust but verify.
this also has to be well tested.

--help -? or -h all work.
wasn't able to mimic the /help  /?
windows world method of option entry.
probably someone knows how.
hope its not a registry setting!

profile options might only be available if you
enter -xpert mode, to avoid confusing anyone who 
thinks they may need to run it because it is there.
and be removed from the help menu as well.

here is the proof of concept leomain.py,
all it does is process commandline args and 
print what command it will run or var it will set.
nothing is actually opened or run.

$ \c\py\python22\python leomain.py some.leo
run(some.leo)

$ \c\py\python22\python leomain.py some.leo -P
profile(leoProfile.txt,some.leo)

$ python leomain.py -profile=/tmp/proFile.txt my favorite.leo
profile(rofile=/tmp/proFile.txt,my favorite.leo)

woops! not sure how to guard against that.
verifing is valid creatable filename could help.
that should have been:

$ python leomain.py --profile=/tmp/proFile.txt my favorite.leo
profile(/tmp/proFile.txt,my favorite.leo)

$ python leomain.py --script some.py some.leo
script some.py
run(some.leo)

$ python leomain.py --script some.py
script some.py
run()

that's the basics.
needless to add, some of the code default 
choices and wording of help messages 
will have to be fine tuned. 
have at it.

post a note if something breaks.
I know of a few typos already.

"""  to run, add your path to leo below if not already set.

proposed modification to leo.py for hprof or hotshot profile 
giving standard help options from the commandline
and making additional options or combinations less work.

using optparse for commandline parsing
for py2.2 will use optik if installed, but not critical
requires copy of optparse.py from py2.4 in leo/extensions
no problem for py2.3+ already in the stdlib
this also need seperate testing, unittests to follow.

to use from command or shell window:
python leomain.py some args, see what happens.
nothing except print will happen, no open or file creation.
presently use a copy of sys.argv but that would be mutated.
if something is not obvious it should be fixed.


comments presently are interspersed throughout the file
will be collected and shortened as bugs are removed.
getting all options and filenames correctly is complicated
by the possibility of unicode or spaces in filenames.
some options require filenames for later processing in run()
and a leo may be specified or even more than one at some point
wildcard handling is not especially cross platform compatible.

want to make it possible to enter filenames w/o quoting
but will be impossible for now for batch & script option params.
they have to have quotes if there are spaces in the filenames on win.

also somewhat ambiguous, -sscript filename
will actually parse as --script cript filename
this could be a source of error and questions.
not sure if it can be avoided if there is to be longword args.

another point, -script is a possible typo to document at least.

a script like this could actually be some kind of leo launcher.
an option could popup a filedialog to get a leo, so it could in Leo.
or open the last leo that has been modified on the local filesystem.
as well as be a test bed for optparse & profile, read from ini file.
not dependant on changing leo.py, just import leo, then leo.run(fname)

for scripting, ability to set argv should be possible somehow.
maybe set sys.argv = [] before run

maybe just breeze through argv trying to concatenate filenames
then try to parse it. and let parseopts save a copy
later calls to parseopts w/o argv will use the saved attribute copy.
probably passing opts+args to run() is cleaner though.


this is the kind of merge that can give cvs merge a bad name, 
good luck!
leoGlobals and change of sys.path used only for testing.
import leoGlobals may not work for the real leo.py this early
before g.app is created. some refactoring is inevitable

why check for win before trying to make filename w/spaces?
does other os not have problem w/spaces in argv w/o quotes?
and why win32? is there no win64 in Leo's user base
or does it not have the space problem w/argv
are single and double quotes around filename the same for other os?
for windows they don't work like double quotes.


the order of parameters might have to be significant
but as it is, the.leo can appear anywhere
and on win, all unused args are joined with spaces just in case
if you do strange stuff possibly you get what you ask for.

does Leo try to find filename.leo if filename is sans the extension?
does it cause an overwrite existing file y/n/c or pass silently overwriting?

-d datadir might be useful if you want to have other than the some.leo same dir
-set somesetting=this like for outline bg color in script playback mode

if leo is started from another shell, argv[0] might not be python or might be
it could be IPython or something else, but there might be its args
as well as the program it started that started Leo
so really, argv should be [find(leo.py'):]
and for some associations or os, no .py or .pyw required
for that matter import leo; leo.run() bypasses option parsing altogether!
this is another problem now that I think of it...
but only if you also expected to get --script or some other option parsed
if you import leo you probably know what you are doing
you would have to set some global options, args I guess is what __main__ will do.
searching to cut back sys.argv for python or python.exe leo etc etc 
is bound to failure, too many cross platform possibilities.

__file__ can also be unreliable when started from py2exe or freeze or a zip

can't so far get /h (a default windows help option) to trigger --help.
seems like if there is no -h option defined, -hanything gets help
could be a source of typo errors 
if other longword no param option started w/'h' 
optparse doesn't handle word-otherword conversion to word_otherword
may be reading the doc wrong on that.
but will handle -sb scriptfile batchfile combining
says -s outfile equivalent to --script=outfile
but what about --script outfile?
carefully avoiding too much smart processing.


hopefully a test suite will expose any anomalies.
the default help output has a few more inconsistencies.
strange there are no bug reports about it in 2 years!
also want to give default values in help, maybe there is a %default

help gets cutoff at 80 chars, 79 according to a lone bugtrack entry
but that was for optparse, nd maybe its base0 counting.
maybe its still bug tracked as optik.sf.net, the original project name.

for future editors, and I sense there will be future edits,
if an individual help entry is longer than ~79 it will get formated ok.


see if we can avoid the ridiculous problem on win where on error
you get an exit and see nothing unless started from console!
source of some forum traffic as well.
maybe, if sys.platform etc: raw_input('press any key to exit')
and for pythonw maybe should popup an alert somehow...
one can dream.

proof of concept, still missing pasing args to run somehow
or seetting an ivar or whatever to get script/batchmode filenames
from main to where it is required. that should be easy enough.



filename is be mandatory for both and it should exist
its checked for batch in leo.py already so checking should be more generic
haven't looked up where --script is processed
didn't rewtrite getbatchfile or whatever its called.
that will be replaced with a check if tobatch has a filename
decide if optparse callback should check for valid existing file
and exit or continue accordingly.

and for an opposing view, if you are scripting leo from another script
then want to enter script mode or batch mode
what has to be available is to intercept the call to read the file.
and pass it a string of the script or batch, w/o problem.
a seperate function instead of hardwireing the read at least.



if I've forgotten anything please post a note to the forums.
beyond that, I don't know what to tell you.
this is proto typical alpha proof of concept pseudo code
although tested somewhat and worked as I expect it to,
it can't be expected to do everything unforseen as well.
and I can't be sure some transmission error hasn't occured.
hold me harmless or hit delete now.

    paramdict is a dict of single letter keys and

    walk the list concatate anything with a space
    to the previous item if it doesn't look like a valid option.
    what are the valid options? we don't care...
    is - s filename parseable as -s:filename ??
    this has got to have generated lots of point counterpoint over the years.
    should do some research... 
    have to decide if will accept / as option seperator or if optparse does
    this may not be doable if we alow options to also have spaces in filenames
    does optparse resolve -ffilename as well as -f:filenname the same?

    lets assume an options param can't have spaces, just get it working for now.
    if you enter an option you better quote it if you need to
    leave the space correcting behaviour for default or trailing filenames only
    
    now there is a problem need to know which oiptions have required params
    otherwise can't decide how to concate, unless the space was preserved (it isn't)
    I think on win or anywhere argv[n][0] is never going to be a space
    dito for argv[n][-1]
    so, its a simple FSM with 2 states, an option or a param
    cancel concatate space if previous was an option
    but here we go again, what about options that don't have params?
    optparse doc talks at length about options not having optional params.
    in Leo's case we may need to pass it a list of options that have no params?
    maybe optparse team needs to gix this not the module user
    maybe someone filed a patch already? more study!
    if not who is going to need optparse after this gets done?
    
    maybe just concatate all trailing args till an option, process backward
    its looking moore like a parser than a FSM now and I need to know too much.
    maybe assume all options have required params for now untill imp paramdict
    what about "-script=name, the doc implys that this may be valid?
    
    all validm but they don't mention -file=outfile, maybe is a typo missing -?
    <yourscript> -f outfile --quiet
    <yourscript> --quiet --file outfile
    <yourscript> -q -foutfile
    <yourscript> -qfoutfile
    damm, this is not going to even be worth trying
    seems -script == --script criptm 
    that could be confusing and error prone

make into a real series of tests
I made the name leo\smain.py because my associateions for py are to open editor
so this could never run leo then open main.py even if I was in leo/src

past parse_args ['leo main.py', 'c:/filename', '/help/some.leo'] leo= c:/filenam
e /help/some.leo
leo.run(c:/filename /help/some.leo)

-script works for --script cript it seems
and that could be a typo missing --script so the next filename
gets concatated into the leo name which I guess can't be helped

OTOH, if you use the default version=
then --versions works but -v or -version doesn't


$ \c\py\python24\python "leo main.py" test.leo -p whatever else
concatate arg ['test.leo', '-p', 'whatever', 'else']
past parse_args ['test.leo', 'else'] leo= 'test.leo else'
profile(whatever, test.leo else)
this is the thing that is still hard to avoid. on win, has to be
$ \c\py\python24\python "leo main.py" test.leo -p "whatever else"

really need to get this tested on other than old win9x,

will it handle spaces in filenames w/o quotes?

leo.py --script filename.leo is not good
leo.py -script filename is not good, which is it a scriptfile or a leo to be?

as error for -profile as an option, going to have to subclass override error
AttributeError Values instance has no attribute 'profile' ["__module__ = 'exceptions' .", "__doc__ = 'Attribute not found.' ."] 
this was a programmer error though, the var is toprofile

little hard to test this as a script, can't control argv
update, sys.argv = seems now to be working from doctest
better readup, haven't used this in a while
haven't read the docs in a while either, a good read.
especially the origional optik.sf.net


need to make this a function to call returning a dict maybe?
at least to doctest it better w/o needing to create a test module 
and then run it saving stdout

its also going to be a little trickier to --script or --batch with --profile
and what is exactly the difference with --batch and --script?
one has no GUI maybe?


- is valid in a filename, so primitive argv parsing
will be difficult to distinguish in a filename w./spaces
since the spaces cause seperate items and just a join
is not good because you have to know if it is a valid arg
what if it is a valid arg? this is a nightmare in any case...


need a timer on operations while getting a profile
expandall, contrract all so can be output with the pstats

need to set options in a seperate function
so can generate test for all functions and params on the fly
this will be good in the general case for other programs

anyone already depending on case insensitive args?

default file for profile not working out
comprimise -P as an option w/o param uses default leoProfile.txt

if -p file name -s some.py will be difficult to get right w/o quoting
will anyone ever expect a default? 
unless thats in the leodir or something?
dito for script and batch but what possible default could they have, 



does x is None work on py2.2?

hprof from google summer of code replace hotshot & profile
much faster on the uptake and output!
has compatibility modules so can use mostly the same calls
this script uses the hprof calls. didn't mod leo.py yet
as I am not able to compile _hotshot.c to pyd or .so
it will use hotshot created profile ok.

added psyco, need to create batch file so can automate & timeit.
also have modified leoGlobals match and a few other things already
and proven You can shave at lest a few seconds overall,

can combine add more than one profile run to get better data
but I don;t do that in this script.

and pypy has lstat which also didn't compile for me
and possibly isn't windows compatible yet
along with another mentioned in this past weeks py-dev summary.


need something to compare the diff of 2 profiles
sorted the same way, something to add comments to the
profile, maybe a simple flatfile to manage profiling.
seems this would have been a project for someone already?

chg leo.py profile to create hotshot profile file
then run, copy a node from library
expand/contract a few times then exit.

takes a few minutes to process the hotshot file
then prints enormous amout of stats...
you see a few leoGlobals called a few hundred thousand times
on a run of 5 or 10 minutes.

Leo's Open Python Window command should take care to run Idle in a separate process.

The present code is essentially:

import idlelib.PyShell
idlelib.PyShell.main()

As the present problems with the Plugins manager show, this has the potential for mischief.  Indeed, idle is a Tkinter process, so Idle's shutdown code could interfere with Tkinter, Pmw, g.app or all three.

It's no good blaming Pmw or Idle or whatever, there needs to be a solid way of avoiding problems, both now and in the future.  The obvious way is to use os.system or subprocess to keep Idle at arm's length.  If necessary we can use settings in leoSettings.leo to tell Leo exactly how to start Idle.

Hi! I need help removing script buttons. It says I should right click the ofending
button. I have a mac and Ctl-click, Command-click, etc doesn't work. What should
I do?

EKR: This is on the list of unfixable bugs, but I have a hard time believing there is no workaround.

- Per-pane key bindings. (arrows, etc.)

::But I don't understand why it's difficult to edit leoSettings.leo

--safe would use default settings,
maybe you set all body fg/bg to the same color
by mistake and you don't have a backup leoSettings to use. as a dumb example.

another nice option would be to override a setting
--set something=whatever
this could breakdown easy and on (older?) windows.
there is a limit to how many chars on a command line.
this would add another layer of choice
yet another chicken egg problem, 
parsing settings before settings can be parsed.

what about override @settings file, its a standard thing.
many people will expect this is possible 
and try it
or even leo.py -? 
help you get for free w/optparse.
--keys emacs anyone? 
especially the first time
untill you can get a chance to edit leoSettings.leo

I have already started enabling optparse
for leo.py so I can try various profile options.
I will post it when it works.

have to check how it handles filenames with spaces
seems that is all Leo is currently doing 
with multiple args, if there is no problem.
and later checking for -batch -script etc.

not to minimize how much work this would be.
parsing options is probably the least difficult part.

I have looked into leo's code and managed to figure out how to change 
some fonts. Here's what I did to change the menu fonts for example.

Fonts for the menu can be set in Code->Gui Tkinter classes->@thin 
leoTkinterMenu.py->Tkinter menu bindings->Routines with Tk 
spellings->new_menu

so to use the system font (linux) I changed the return statement to:

return Tk.Menu(parent,tearoff=tearoff, font=("System",11))

I'll try using .leo_xresources file and see if that works as well.

::improving how Leo handle's arguments? 

Leo only needs a few simple options.
I don't think option handling would
work correctly in the IPYthon case either.

put optparse.py in leo/extensions for py2.2
docutils installs it if it isn't available.
its been the standard since py2.3
adding new options will be much less painfull.
some kind of --safe startup to allow editing
of leoSettings.leo, no @buttons or @scripts
might be a good thing.

Leo should allow scripts to set sys.argv for
commands they create. its very difficult to do now.

- Call menu.defineMenuTables from menu.createMenusFromTables.
  This ensures the keyHandler class has been created.

- Added support for using minibuffer command names instead of command in menu
tables. This is a signal that the command is a new-style minibuffer command
rather than a legacy command. This required minor changes in createMenu entries
and defineMenuCallback.

When reversing the search direction, it would be better to place the cursor
'on the other side' of the current hit, and then proceed to find the next occurrence
of <pattern>. At the current state of affairs, searching in the reverse direction
first finds the current occurrence _again_, just placing the cursor on the other
side of the higlighted selection.

This suggestion is based on the way searching in Vim works.

Hi Edward. I've been using the linux and windows version but would like to try
leo on the mac. The install instructions seem a bit out of date. I take it any
additional downloading of TclTkAqua is unneccessary?

I have python2.4 in addition to the stock python 2.3.5 that comes with osx 10.4.
Launching leo like so:  "python2.4 leo.py", as I do on linux, seems to run just
fine.

I don't know if this was fixed on osx or in leo in general, but moving the mouse
to each of the panes and scrolling with the wheel works just great now. Thanks.

Plugin manager: the plugin text font is really tiny, and the window opens to
a default width such that the 'Installed Plugins' button reads 'talled Plugi'.
Resizing the window does stretch the buttons horizontally.

Ok -- here's maybe a big issue. I open a new leo file (File->New) and type in:

for i in range(3):

I hit return after the colon, but a newline is not entered.

   RE: Dividing The Undo: doing w/o v.uA 
2005-09-09 14:17  
> If we can open up how [Leo] reads xml, it may make it simpler to start developing a stash scheme. 
 
I agree that reading xml more properly would be A Good Thing (tm). As we shall see, however, it is not the main issue. 
 
> DOM seems like a good path to start out on. 
 
This is not the path I would have chosen. The new colorizer at in leoPlugins.leo at: 
 
Plugins-->Experimental/unfinished-->New colorizer-->@thin __jEdit_colorizer__.py 
 
uses sax. I like the light-weight approach. I would rather do a bit more work in the initial parsing and create the data structures myself then relying on DOM. 
 
But parsing is irrelevant. The problem is the design of *thin* derived files and the code that reads such files. Let us consider how we can "do without" v.unknownAttributes in thin derived files. I **shall not** change the format of thin derived files, so some trickery is required. The first step is read this section of Leo's new docs: 
 
http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/customizing.html#adding-extensible-attributes-to-nodes-and-leo-files  /> 
The key here is the so-called 'hidden machinery'. This is an essential feature of the code that reads and writes thin derived files and it **will not** change. **Note**: Leo has two sets of read code: the code that reads .leo files has no trouble whatever recreating vnodes. It is only vnodes in thin derived files that may not have attributes. 
 
**Important**: for @thin trees (in the outline) Leo saves *only* the <v> element corresponding to the @thin node itself. It is this <v> element that contains the 'hidden machinery'. Don't even think about having Leo write the whole tree of <v> elements: the 4.0 read code is made possible because these <v> elements do *not* exist. This eliminates all the error 'recovery' schemes that can not, if fact, be robust enough. 
 
So the only real alternative is to add uA's sufficient to recreate elements in the *reconstituted* vnodes that Leo creates in the leoAtFile read logic. Happily, we can do this as follows. When writing, a plugin (or an extended Leo) would 'piggyback' the vnode attributes in the corresponding **t**.unknownAttributes field. When reading, the plugin (or Leo) would put the vnode attributes "where they belong" in the appropriate vnode. We associate a 'vnode traversal index' with each vnode. This is simply how many previous "same" vnodes appeared in the traversal before getting to the desired vnode. Something like this:: 
 
vx = {} # traversal indices for vnodes. 
for p in c.allNodes_iter(): 
....n = vx.get(p.v.t,0) # n is the traversal index for vnode p.v. 
....vx[p.v.t] = n+1 # bump the index for the next v such that v.t == p.v.t 
 
We store attributes for vnode v in v.t.unknownAttributes, along with the traversal index. The read code uses the traversal index to copy vnode attributes from t.unknownAttributes to v.unknownAttrutes. Rather than forcing each plugin to do this, Leo should probably have support for this in the leoFileCommands read/write code. In short, the t.unknownAttributes machinery suffices in theory, and in practice a bit of support code would be good. 
 
Glad you asked :-) . I have been willing to live without v.uA's in thin derived files. I never thought much about this until you asked, but necessity is the mother... So this is good. A way exists to treat all vnodes as first-class citizens.

 Compressed LEO files   
2003-01-07 16:57


Would it be possible to have a new file format that was basically a compressed
version of LEO files? Maybe using the gzip compression method. You could then
save a lot of space when you do large files. Not being a professional
programmer myself (I mainly dabble in web design - HTML and Active Server
Pages) how difficult would this be to implement? You would just output using a
different file extension so users of the older versions can still use files
with the LEO extension.

I made an experiment last night. I replaced the call to open()in leofilecommand.py
with a call to gzip.open().

The LeoPy.leo file saved this way is only 600K! And there is no significant
speed down in saving.

I think it is a good idea to add compression support for load/save .leo files.
When reading or writing file with name ending with ".leo.gz", leo can call gzip
module to uncompress/compress the file, saving a lot of disk space.

What do you think of this?

>>Making Leo a friendly part of the opml world has the potential to be very
important to Leo. <<

This is probably point 5. and covers the implementation of opml features as
exposed in Leo.

Because Leo is highly scripted there may be many requests... currently out on
the OPML list... that are solveable....such as how to see their outlines as
HTML without passing thru the OPML web server /host. BTW...all this new opml
stuff is only a week or two in production. The first message on
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml-newbies/
is July 25.

>> The question of whether to duplicate body text in <outline> elements
is minor<<

Good. 

Really, the opml tools are pretty much raw text/xml  and I was thinking the
default fallback is ... all clone text is "duplicate". If you want clones then
you will take care to only edit them in Leo. But if opml users all know and
use clones routinely in other editors,  then this is good news for opml
as technology.

>>more complicated than it needs to be<<

Well, both Leo and opml have only a few elements and each primarilly uses one
which recusively nests to make up the outline portion. I suppose body nodes
could be included more directly in headlines ... allowing un-numbered headlines
basically, ... but I am not sure that the current way is inferior
or complicated.

 A simpler (forgiving?) format might make it easier to create with external
apps and encourage transforming other xml to Leo via XSLT. It would have to
just "work".

(One thing about Leo's bias towards elements to contain markup, versus attributes,
is that ...you can cheat a little on escaping &quot; in vh or t nodes ?...which
makes code blocks smaller in the Leo xml.)

Your list above is pretty much how I see it as well.

regards,

bill p

By: billp9619

Looking at some discussion of outline formats there was a remark that because
opml places all text in attributes it is limited in not being able to contan
other elements. On xml-dev I also saw some advice about opml followed by the
comment that it is not a good format.

opml is crippled in this regard but  Leo only restricts itself as a choice in
order to  discern leo xml from content.(out of necessity we know).

Of course with xml you can mix vocabularies based on the use of namespaces.
By becoming namespace aware Leo could be adapted for non-escaped markup. The
purpose then is xml parsing of leo as a standard container of other xml. I do
not believe this is unthinkable  for some future capabilities... especially
if such nodes would contain exclusively xml from another namespace.

Just interesting that leo's format is more versatile than opml, 
but, ...by choice for its own purposes, ...
 is in this part "backward" compatible with opml. :)

Hi,

I am the author of Leo http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html an outline editor supporting clones http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/intro.html#clones-views.

I am interested in having Leo be able to read and write opml files.  My understanding is that applications are free to use attributes of <outline> elements as they please, but I am wondering whether there are guidelines or existing conventions for representing clones.  Have any namespaces been defined for that purpose?

Thanks.

[quote]It turns out that munging whitespace can be extremely time consuming.
I once tried to do a user setting that would end all non-empty body text with
exactly one newline. That effectively hung Leo. I'm not sure if there was a
blunder in the code that caused this, but it may well have been that mass changes
like this are inherently expensive. So we should not assume that 'innocent'
whitespace changes are in fact easy to do.
[quote]

CVS stores files in the RCS format. The latest version is stored directly, the
other versions are stored as line differences (delete lines x-y, insert 3 lines
at z) relative to the latest version. If you change the empty line convention,
you might create lots of differences of the above form which might be expensive
to compute.

This should be a onetime cost, however, which, if you will, you could do one
file at a time.

I woudn't let a tool like CVS determine if I would  change the convention.

As for white space differences: TortoiseSVN (I have not used TortoiseCVS) allows
you to specify external programs. There should be some out there which allow
you to ignore white space differences when comparing files.

On a related note: I read that subversion is in Beta on SourceForge. You might
want to think about switching to subversion once it is officially supported.
One example of a project which has switched from CVS to subversion is the project
which maintains the Python sources itself (see, for example,
http://www.python.org/dev/devfaq.html#subversion-svn)

By: bwmulder

If I understand correctly, there are two different problems:

- Trailing whitespaces
- Left indented comments

1. Before commenting on these, a question:

If I write something like
    a=b
    if a:
        @others

[four spaces indentation]

I sometimes see tab characters before the lines inserted for '@others'.

It seems that Leo remembers 'two levels of indentation', and then
fabricates this indentation using tab characters.

I think it might be more robust if Leo remembered the actual
characters in front of @others and would use them for indentation.

I suspect that many indentation errors I had with Leo could have been
avoided had not Leo had its own ideas on how to do indentation.

Maybe Leo could use the exact sequence of characters in front of
@others for all inserted lines?

2. I do not care much about trailing whitespaces. Most of the time
they are invisible, but sometimes they are very misleading (trailing in python or C).

As far as I am concerned, Leo need never produce trailing whitespaces.

Maybe we need special machinerie if sources have trailing whitespaces
and the sources are not under our control. 

Not sure if everybody would be happy if we essentially ban all trailing
whitespaces.

3. Unindented commentlines could be dealt with by using indentation to
indicate structure.

Of course, this might break the correspondance Leo structure / Python
structure, which is very ugly.

4. One possible alternative might be a new directive which indicates outindent:

@outindent <number>.

This would apply to the next comment block.

To me, 4. looks a little bit less ugly than 3.

5. As indicated in a different post, I suspect that Leo has a problem
if almost every node in an outline is changed. Profiling should point
to the culprit.

> 2. Have Leo strip whitespace from otherwise blank lines, and hope
that that solves all problems in Perfect Import. This is solving the
problem in the atFile code. The problem is that if we apply settings
in general we will get massive changes to derived files. In most
programming settings these changes might be welcome, but the problem
is actually making these changes. My first few attempts met with
abject failure.

Are you saying that you could not remove trailing blanks? What kind of
problems did you run into?

Summary:
- Use actual characters in front of @others or <<>> for indentation.
- Don't write trailing whitespaces
- Introduce directive for left-indendet comments.
- Profile to find out what slows Leo down if many nodes change.

Alas, this really does not solve problems with Import.

- "asis":  ideal, maybe not possible?
- "zero": no trailing newlines.
- "one": exactly one trailing newline.

Special case code is required so empty nodes stay empty with "one" option.

@ Rewritten 10/11/02 as follows:

1. We call initConfigParam and initBooleanConfigParam to get the values.

The general purpose code will enter all these values into configDict.  This allows update() to write the configuration section without special case code.  configDict is not accessible by the user.  Rather, for greater speed the user access these values via the ivars of this class.

2. We pass the ivars themselves as params so that default initialization is done in the ctor, as would normally be expected.

Is it only me who sees this as a question on how to reinvent the wheel? (or
in the case of emacs, how to reinvent the <i>everything</i>.)

Leo and Python both seem so well suited as wonderful hierarchal glue programs.
And both are so elegant in the way their simple functionality brings such power
and order to the cause. It just seems it would be a shame to take something
so novel and unique and try to turn it into <i>yet another</i> huge text editor.

I'm with <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2345873">Danny
</A> on this one. The ideal solution is to find the most elegant and seamless
way to splice one's own beloved text editor (or multipurpose editor/OS) in with
the Leo paradigm. Have Leo hand off the text duties to the editor, or have the
editor deliver heirarchy commands to Leo.

I'm also quite curious if this makes a good tie in with SciTE. SciTE produces
stunningly readible language highlighting/formatting. Could it be employed for
basic cell text display, and then for heavier editing, a keystroke or button
could open the cell text in one's preferred weapons grade text editor?

Scintilla also has a similarly beautiful code-to-html and code-to-pdf capability
that seems very suited to the literary part of the Leo paradigm: publication.
It would be nice if that code could be exploited as well.

This Leo is really a marvelous work. It's transforming the way I think (i.e.
making it possible again). Nice work, Edward.

 RE: What would it take to turn Leo into Emacs   
2003-12-23 09:18  

 I agree with the embedding; I've used the vim plugin and it works well, but actually embedding the editor directly into the text field of leo (and allowing a range of keyboard shortcuts for eg headline editing) would be perfect.

There is some support for this in gvim, the GUI version of vim that comes as standard. This can be run so as its GUI is "embedded" in another GTK widget, using that library's GtkSocket/GtkPlug system. A quick demo of that (and how to do it in python) is here:

http://www.daa.com.au/pipermail/pygtk/2003-October/006185.html

To see this working with gvim, run the second (socket.py) program on that page then type

gvim --socketid <number generated by socket.py>

I'm not sure how you could do this in other widget libraries - I don't know much about X Windows, but I suppose it would need support in vim as well as the widget set.

I use XEmacs as my text editor.  The first thing I did when
evaluating Leo was to set up "open with" to use XEmacs for editing
Leo body text.

My progress so far:

- my Open_With Plugin opens a Leo node as a foreground buffer in
XEmacs, or a background (invisible) buffer in XEmacs.

- my Open_Tree Plugin opens a sub-tree of Leo nodes as background
buffers in XEmacs.

- my filename modification plugin changes the temporary file names
used by Leo so that they can be spotted more easily in an XEmacs
buffer listing (e.g. ibuffer).

- an elisp function to kill all XEmacs Leo buffers at once.

- another elisp function to indent and unindent the Leo comments in
derived Python source, which improves the readability of code.

- my setup of the elisp Multiple-Major-Modes XEmacs package, so that
XEmacs is in text-mode in Leo @doc sections, and the correct
language mode in @code sections.

Any of these might be able to be adapted for your own use. They
should all work with Emacs as well as XEmacs, but I've not tested
that.

These are all outlined in Appendix "C. XEmacs Text Editor" of the
document at:
    http://devguide.leo.marshallresearch.ca

and the Leo outline that contains them is available
at:

#@+node:ekr.20041022144159:Q: Pymacs bridge
I'm trying to use the Pymacs bridge to add a symbol completion facility to
Emacs's python-mode.  Neither the Python nor Emacs Lisp portions are all
that complex, but I'm having trouble passing a list of strings from Emacs
Lisp into Python.  On the Emacs Lisp side it looks like this:

    (pymacs-load "pycomplete")

    (defun py-complete ()
      (interactive)
      (pycomplete-pycomplete (py-symbol-near-point)
                             (py-find-global-imports)))

(py-find-global-imports) returns a (Lisp) list of strings, e.g.:

    ("import time", "import sys")

On the Python side I have this function:

    def pycomplete(s, imports=None):
        completions = get_all_completions(s, imports)
        dots = s.split(".")
        return os.path.commonprefix([k[len(dots[-1]):] for k in completions])

Unfortunately, the imports arg does not come across as a Python list of
strings (s does come across the bridge as a normal Python string).  Its
repr() prints out like this:

    lisp('("import time")')

What do I need to do to convert that object into a true Python list of
strings?  I'm afraid I don't quite understand the description of the lisp
object in the Pymacs docs.  I tried imports.value() but that just gave me

    (aref pymacs-lisp 0)

Any help appreciated...

I have been thinking for a while that it ought to be possible to somehow  to
unite Leo with wiki features (my thinking is still vague at this point).

If you look at systems like Tiddlywiki (http://www.tiddlywiki.com/) you will
find that they already pretty much provide all the formatting features mentioned
in the article.

MoinMoin, another wiki (http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de), has started to use
a graphical interface for editing in the latest version.

Maybe Leo can be split up into three components:

1. A storage component is responsible for storing nodes. Currently, this is
just memory, but databases like shelve, Zope or sqllite should also be possible.

2. The control component is responsible for converting from the internal format
to external files which can be processed by existing compilers, searching within
a document, and the like.

3. A display component is responsible for interfacing with the user. If can
be TK, but it can also be something like the Tiddlywiki interface, which immediately
shows the formatting applied to text.

I don't know much about javascript, so I would have to learn more about this
language before doing anything in this direction.

As an intermediate step, maybe we could allow mixing RST processing with regular
program text.  Leo would produce two documents out of a source file: a version
for the compiler in plain ascii, and an HTML file for reading the source.

> It appears that @ref nodes introduce a flexibility that can not be simulated (at all?) with clones.  
 
Now that something like @ref appears necessary, it is so much easier to see how @ref is useful :-) 
 
1. @ref is an explicit link (arc) that creates the links of a general graph structure explictily. 
 
The simplest cycle is: 
 
- root 
..- a 
.... - @ref b 
..- b

Imho ...

There will not be any "arbitrary graph" from @ref. Instead there is a forest
of trees, and across trees, some nodes are same_as some other nodes (caused
by @ref). same_as is transitive. Quite likely the roots of all trees are same_as.
There may need to be some rules to ensure things make structural sense. Children
of a node are just that -- children of that node.

There will be a totally separate Merge node whose children will be the union
of the children of all the nodes it merges. A Merge node is, itself, the ordinary child of some
node.

Tree traversals will be tree traversals.

Hope that did not muddy the waters even more ...

Ive been scanning Speed Reams Slash post and the Faq and saw an interesting
usage pattern: Creating a node called a Task and adding cloned nodes to it that
represent that task(I hope that explains it).  I can see myself using this idiom
in the future.  Now my question is does the Task/clone idiom warrant special
commands in Leo?  My basis:

1. Do enough Leo users work with this idiom that making it easier to utilize
would be desirable?  I guess a good rule of thumb might be, if the sequence
of actions occur more frequently than the primitive commands like opening a
file it should be considered.

Maybe a way of doing it:

1. A special mark node as Task command.
2. A Add to lask marked task command, that clones a node and moves that node
into the Task node.

 having a declone() method for vnodes?   
2004-03-15 04:36  

 hi,

Ive had a use for a declone() method in vnodes recently. Have you ever thought about adding a method that declones a clone? This would entail:

1. Making a clone node a normal node.

I can see this happening when cutting a node and pasting a node that is a clone. But there doesn't seem to be a dedicated function to do the operation. :)

In the multifile plugin there is an option to insert a directory string.  I
use it alot for the @path directive.  What happens is that when executed a FileDialog
opens up and the user selects the directory he wants to use as a directory string.
When chosen the directory string is inserted into the text editor.

The good of this:
1. It makes using path simpler, you dont have to type out the directory path
yourself, just use the tkFileDialog to select it and have Leo insert the string.
For long directories this saves a lot of typing.

simple, short and quite helpful.  Thoughts? :)

By: gilshwartz
Open discusstion

Currently Extract Section is only available if the first line in a selection
is a section name <<x>>. I would like to propose a few enhancements I think
should be useful, while I believe most of the code is already implemented in
Leo.

1. If the first line in a selection is not <<x>>, than Extract Section WILL
make a section name from the first line (or a version of it, see below), leave
the section name in the body, create a new node with that section name, and
will copy the selection including the first line to the new node.

Rational: this is useful when selecting a function or a class. Thus the section
name becomes the function or the class definition. The section name can either
be the full first line, or, knowing the language, Leo can make a nice section
name like it does in import, e.g. "function foo", or "class bar", without the
parameters list.

2. Even better, when Extract Section is called WITHOUT a selection it will look
for the first function/class definition before the cursor's position and will
either use it as a selection and do 1 above, or just mark it as selection, which
will enable 1 above upon a second Extract Section.

Rational: Leo does it beautifully in import and when a node's code starts to
build it is most convenient. Also, I think a variation on this was recently
asked by another user.

3. Add an option Merge Section, which when called from a named section will
merge it back to all the sections containing it.

Rational: make it easy (together with 2) to create/delete sections until the
sections picture of a new code becomes clear.

Simpler & more intutive:
Mark text, select from menu - 'extract section', this presents a dialog box
in which you fill in the section name. It is too much work to type <<name>>
then select the whole thing...

As an enhancement, the dialog can show the first line of the selection as the
default section name, which obviously can be changed.

moot as it will be with the new config options

maybe there is a single point to involke clear 
undo that could be run from a button?

with py2.3 after allot of small edits on an open leo after a few hours gc can
hit unexpectedly and last several minutes
and return at any time lasting several more minutes.
I think its gc related because the memory use and disk grinding demanding I
free up memory or kill python.

I have no idea if undo is the cause,
 just guessing.
using cvs of last week. I just updated, 
will let you know if it happens again.
(new error reporting jump to error is great)

usually I don't edit in the same process that long.
I have run scripts from leo that run 6, 12 
or 24 hours no problem. 
maybe I can turn on some internals reporting and
get some feedback on whats going on from python if it happens again. 
or run the gc script before and after.

but I go from 50% free to 10% when this starts happening.
I haven't noticed this problem yet in py2.4, and it is peppier,
but don't use py2.4 enough. it doesn't happen every day.
I reboot at least once a day for various reasons.
so it isn't that either. 
you do need to reboot and or exit python once it starts.
this was never an issue with py2.2 and Leo 4.1 or less with only 64 megs.
I don't really have any other long running python processes to compare to Leo. 
can't say what it is.
Aha, progress. 
this started sometime early in 4.2 or late 4.1
but I can still be persuaded something in my 
local system is to blame, some install or dll update. or script, psyco or plugin
related.

nonwithstanding, I should be taking better advantage Moore's law in my CPU and
memory.
I only notice this when I'm running the same leo over a few hours of constant
editing and running scrips.
and when I exit python and restart leo everything returns to normal.

Other options I though would be really handy:

1. Use an existing node as a source also

2. Use an node from another Leo file.. I am not sure what the syntax for that
would be exactly

3. From a URL.. this would be really cool. People could post outlines not only
as existing Leo xml files, but as text files or even dynamic scripts. The code
to handle these would presumably need to deal with http:// intelligently. But
that's easy in Python. Rebol is great at that too.

4. Other XML file with valid filepaths in them.
That's probably a much bigger project like Leo 3.10

Proposal: modify the code for @url so that if you type for example just "@url"
(no file specified) in a headline, a window pops up allowing you to browse the
local file system and select the file (similar to what browsers do when you
want to open a file).

This would be more convenient than manually writing @url
file://a/long/path/to/the/file. @read-only nodes already allow this, it would
perhaps be nice if all these types of plugins (@folder might be another one
for example) and directives (@file etc) had the same behavior (and this should
probably be specified in some guidelines for writing new plugins -see e.g. the
jedit plugin guidelines).

@ Here is the Python 2.4 documentation for rename (same as Python 2.3)

Rename the file or directory src to dst.  If dst is a directory, OSError will be raised.

On Unix, if dst exists and is a file, it will be removed silently if the user
has permission. The operation may fail on some Unix flavors if src and dst are
on different filesystems. If successful, the renaming will be an atomic
operation (this is a POSIX requirement).

On Windows, if dst already exists, OSError will be raised even if it is a file;
there may be no way to implement an atomic rename when dst names an existing
file.

Perhaps some minor bridling ...

What about managing the security of scripts using some algorithm like this,

1. When Leo scans for @buttons, @scripts etc it makes a list of scripts
2. For each script ...
3.   Calculate a secure hash of the script contents
4.   Consult central repository to see if hash is recognized
5.   If hash recognized
6.     Accept it
7.   Else
8.     Force user to acknowledge the script or disable it

The cental repository could be a file in your Leo directory which stores "approved"
hashes.

Clicking on a @buttons, @script node and selecting "Approve script" would add
the hash to the repository. Selecting "Disable script" would remove it. There
could also be a menu item to bring up a window of approved/not approved script
nodes so that you could centrally manage them.


Additional housekeeping on the list of hashes is possible but probably isn't
required since the size is small and there shouldn't be any collisions. If required
you could just blow away the file and then re-enable all scripts.

Using this approach, no new script would be able to run without being enabled
by the user. There is still the possibility that another plugin or script could
disable the security mechanism or tamper with the repository but with Leo's
architecture a plugin could already do anything anyway so this isn't an additional
hole.

It would protect from 

@script
import os
os.system("del *.*")

being submitted to an OS project!

I'm not an expert but from the Python docs this looks like the way to do it,

> import sha
> s = sha.sha("hello there")
> s.hexdigest()
'6e71b3cac15d32fe2d36c270887df9479c25c640'

> s = sha.sha("hello there hacked")
'a42837bba84c53cabd52a98f3671809d475c707f'

It looks like the md5 module offers a similar function but uses less bits.

From what I understand the hexdigest should be different for any change in the
text. Also no two strings should give the same hash (although I seem to recall
that someone found a collision recently).

It is stated that you can edit the temporary file with the editor as named in the "Open with..." submenu.
However, the temporary files are edited with the application that is associated with their extension. In my case I always fire up vim with .txt-files.

Hence the menu item would be better called something like "Open as..." with submenu items like ".doc file" or ".txt file"

Or, use something else instead of "os.startfile" to really use the intended editor.

import is another area Leo is too hardwired

then pass the string to Leo to do the dirty work, adding new languages for import could be easier.
I'm at this point in a new html file import,

By: Offray

I was previously thinking in the relation between Leo and Wikis, and I think
that may be a thing that would help to make Leo more visible in Wiki space could
be if Leo can export/import to/from a Wiki (something limilar to th @file or
@url directives). Let me explain a little better the scenary where this idea
come.

We have a local wiki for colombian Free Software Community related issues, and
I have used Leo for writing the migration scripts from Mediawiki to MoinMoin
(wich I think is more flexible and extensible that the popular wiki behind
wikipedia). I was probing also the idea of a Wiki like environment for solving
colaborative problems, so I was posting the scripts I made on Leo in a Wiki
page, and republishing them in the moment they changed. This keeps me pasting
all the time the script and in some moments I was thinking what about if someone
make a change in the Wiki page. Would be nice then to have the same capability
to detect and sincronize that change as Leo make with the hard disk files.

But this doesnt end here. Another Wiki-Leo interaction is to use outlines as
a way to organice Wiki content. For example "= Title =" in a Wiki would be a
Outline Node in Leo and "== Subtitle ==" Would become a outline subnode all
arranged in the proper hierarchy.

Somekind of Wisiwyg display would be nice, but this must be a plugin or something
like that, so Leo could become a "Layered" front end to some kind of data.

About and article on Wikipedia. That would be nice, but I'm a little tired of
fighting with some wikipedians ignorance on certain matters combined with power
(a pretty bad combination). I think that a Wiki page is nice because its live
comes from the community knowledge, but I'm not interested in that fighting,
so I have made a Leo wiki page in our local Wiki:

http://www.el-directorio.org:8080/Leo

and when I have enough knowledge about Leo (and time) I hope to start making
contribs in the spanish documentation (for the moment I'm only workind in the
evangelism here).

It would be cool to have 'Next' and 'Prev' 
capability while in this mode, effortlessly 
traversing views of the source of the stack items.

Also; 
Zope3, with it's component based architecture,
has machinery which hooks components together ..
Interfaces, Adapters and ZCML, the configuration
language.

It sounds like the autocompleter code is able
to build indexes of classes and methods. It would
be cool if that capability could be extensible,
allowing building indexes of the couplings between
components.

I think this might look like some kind of automatic
hyperlinking, providing access to related code,
as defined for that application.

I really don't know if this makes sense, but
I see you moving in the direction of making Leo
capable of doing some _explaining_ of the code 
being written.

I think this holds lots of promise.

Thanks,
Kent

In the @view plugin is a method, currentPath() which examines the current headline
and body, and the headlines and bodies of it's parents, looking for @path and
@view directives. It builds a path from them and checks for validity.

if a top level node contains;
@path /home/ktenney

and a descendant of that node contains;
@path projects/myproject

Then a node further down the tree which contains;
@view readme.txt

will display /home/ktenney/projects/myproject/readme.txt

I like this principle of cumulative paths, and would like other plugins to work
the same way ... @image, @url etc.

This brings me to my question, would it make sense for Leo to offer a 'Plugin'
class to inherit from? It seems that there are some operations that are being
re-written in many plugins.

On leo4.2, winXP, my default language is Python and smart_auto_indent=0. 
Normally, after ending a line with a colon, the next line gets indented by 1 tab, also in comment-sections. 
When using an @killcolor directive in a node, the line following one that ends with a colon starts at column zero. 
I think it is unreasonable for @killcolor to interfere with indenting.

 use of @language   
2003-07-16 03:40  

I am wondering why Leo does not default to just use the file suffix in @file nodes, instead of obliging @language line in in the body pane 

For example any @file ending with a suffix as defined in the language extensions could just default to use those. 

".py" for python 
".r" for rebol 
".as" for actionscript etc.. 

Should anyone need to over-ride those, they could use @language.

Treat @language like @color: ambiguous nodes (nodes containing more than one

Hate to break into the grand design discussions, but here's a hopefully small thing. If you need to place a good sized copyright statement at the top of your files, LEO doesn't handle this case very cleanly. As I'm sure you're aware, you wind up with a matching number of @@first lines for each leading line in your source. 

As an example: 
# 1 
# 2 
# 3 
# 4 
# 5 
#@verbatim
#@+leo 
#@verbatim
#@+node:0::@file /tmp/firstcheck.py

#@@first

#@@first 
#@verbatim
#@@first 
#@verbatim
#@@first

# 
# How many firsts do I get? 

#@verbatim
#@-doc 
#@verbatim
#@@c 
Start code. 
#@verbatim
#@-body 
#@verbatim
#@-node:0::@file /tmp/firstcheck.py 
#@verbatim
#@-leo 

My fellow co-workers who don't use LEO, aren't exactly loving me here. 

Might we introduce an: 

@@first <num> 

Type tag instead? So one '@@first 5' could represent all 5 of the above @@first lines? It makes for a smaller, cleaner LEO footprint and will tick off non-LEO users much less. 

Thanks.

RE: Haskell support  
2004-11-18 22:55

There's a literate programming mode in Haskell (and in a number of other functional programming languages such as Clean & Curry), where the program is in a comment, usually where the line starts with ">" (bird track style, I think it's called), and the comments/documentation are freeform. It would be difficult but cool if Leo could support it, if only because the sentinels in the derived files wouldn't make whole file look so busy.

All plugins I have tried (notably @run and the @rst variants) have their working
directory set to my home directory, regardless of the position of the Leo file
and all @path directives. This renders most of them useless, since I would have
to use absolute pathnames. Is this the way they were meant to work, or is there
a bug somewhere? Or maybe I have missed some configuration parameter?

I am using Leo 4.2 with Python 2.3 on Linux.

> All plugins I have tried (notably @run and the @rst variants) have their working directory set to my home directory, regardless of the position of the Leo file and all @path directives.

Directory issues are different on different platforms.

I would welcome specific proposals for setting directories during startup.  Early in the startup process Leo sets g.app.loadDir to the directory from which Leo was loaded.  Plugins can use this directory to set the working directory as they choose.

@path directives will have no effect on plugins:  they are loaded before the outline.

> This renders most [plugins] useless, since I would have to use absolute pathnames.

No, it means you might have to add a few lines of code to your plugin to make it work just as you would like it to work.

> Is this the way they were meant to work?

I don't have much control over how plugins were "meant" to work.  However, an improved plugin manager might have facilities for setting the working directory.

This is a non-trivial issue;   Leo uses and sets paths in many places in the code.  It seems dubious to have plugins change the working directory at random times.  Perhaps an option that inits the working directory would be good.  The new config system will allow per-outline options as well as global option. I believe such options could be loaded before plugins.

Please ignore if this is a difficult feature to implement.

I would prefer if it opened to the last directory from

-- pdf -- 
yes I know what you mean, PDF has it uses.  If nicely embedded into Leo via
'reportwriter'  and some export scripts {and clear useinterfance} would stillbe
a good thing.


As I start to think about how to print Leo, I become more aware of the differneces
between Leo structures and linear [print] layouts.

Different kinds of outlines obviously will need different kinds of printing.
I don't yet have enough experience or overview.

--xslt--
Seems a natural way to go for printing Leo, but yet another langauge and syntax
to wrassle with. Last time I looked I went from being horrified to very impressed
to be being exhausted.

--htmlize--
thanks I'll check into that

"print to web"  should definitely be on Leo's missing PRINT MENU.

--swf [flash]--
This printing topic pushes me harder to get FLC  [my FlashLeoClient project]
into the Leosphere.

Flash has*limited*  CSS handling, but enough to do some nice and useful typographic
formatting in a pretty clean object-oriented manner.

FLC parses .leo files into a Flash object. Flash Textformat instances are created
using CSS and can be applied then to rendering any parts of  the deserialized
Leo object.. The beauty is it can be very fast and ynamic so I can imagine a
real-time WYSIWYG laytou tool for printing Leo to web and at the same making
it suitable at the same time for print-to-paper.

Since FLC is in the very first instance a READ-ONLY client tool for Leo, it
makes it a natural Leo printing service.

To complete full service, it woudl be good if Leo could create SWF files directly
itself, just like using PDF reportwriter.
There are a couple of libraries to help this 
- Ming [with PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby wrappers]
http://ming.sourceforge.net/

- makeswf.r [interesting REBOL/Flash dialect by David Oldes]
http://sweb.cz/oliva.david/swf/

These could also be both configured as web-services.
So Leo print-to-web would include by default rendering a flash swf file versoin
of itself either using locally installed libraries or by passing a view of itself
to a chosen client or server-based tool.

But even without those extra 'services' and libraries a single flash file in
the form of FLC could become an effective Leo printing kit. Using a standalone
desktop  version [not embedded in the browser, out of the sandbox] much more
is possible - remote control, peer-peer editing, file writing etc.

-- flashpaper2--
btw, Lately I've been using Flashpaper2 a lot to print all kinds of stuff, Often
from web pages to my local adhoc home filebase. It's a very fast lighweight
alternative to PDF, saves paper, has excellent zooming and nice search features
built-in.
Flashpaper renders a very litteral snapshot, but as I am discovering that turns
out to be extremely useful.
For example you visit a page and click on some links. Flashpaper saves teh pages
exactly as it looks, viisted links disntinguished.  In the era of info-overload,
even that crude mnemonic is valuable.

Alas, Flashpaper2 is not free nor open in the way Leo is. But worth to play
with it if only for for the experience.
30 day trial downlaod from
http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashpaper/

And of course the flash _players_ is free, so can send people flashpaper documents
just like PDF.
Brilliant when you have a big Excel spreadsheet or CAD document which would
normally get all messy printing across pages, confusing people.
Instead adjust and print to a generous 'piece' of flashpaper - letting your
coleagues pan and zoom to their comfort.

I've not quite figured out the place where  Leo meets Flashpaper, because Leo
needs to preserve its full pane contents. Flashpaper works fine with long web
pages, automatically reading the full window contents and cutting into a paginated
sequence, ready for paper printing.
Leo's does not have aprint menu, so it's off the sytem's print-devices map,
which Flash paper appearing just  like any phtycial printer.

I imagine is possible to fix that in Leo, but I do not where to begin and woudl
not be surprised to learn its a major heachche to write adn debug for multiple
operating systems.

An immediate alternative are screencapture tools like vnc2swf or MDM Capture.

[vnc2swf uses Ming-0.2a]
http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/

http://www.multidmedia.com/software/capture/index.php

But much is hidden or lost from view. 
Still very vauable for creating dynamic narrative tutorials [aka screencasting]

AS you know I am very excited about what flash can do for Leo, and vice versa.
But I am concerned that there is not yet a 100% Leo means which supports people's
standard print needs and habits.
   
-- PRINT MENU-- 
Leo deserves good friendly printing features which anyone can use. At the moment
we have a confusing patchwork of choices. Printing Leo seems to be both harder
and easier than  first meets the eye.

Having a little library of export scripts - well named, documented and intended
to aid printing woudl go a long way. Thesse scripts anyone coiuld be called
by onayone given a Leo Outline, accessing a navabr button. PRINT MENU or list.
Or they can just insert the appropriate script  into an outline giving finer
grained print control on the fly.

fujitsu-siemens.com/products/software/openseas/openft.html)

It is based on a TCL library htmllib.tcl, written by Stephen Uhler in 1995 while
working in Sun's TCL group.Iit seemts that this lib is owned by Sun and i'm
not certain about license. It is freely downloadable, anyway.

The usage is really simple -- you have to create a text widget, a string variable
containing html text and a link callback, then feed all three to the library
routine. It should be not hard pythonize this process.

see http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/1999-8/features/tclsh.html,
ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/misc/html_library-0.3.tar.gz
or just google for htmllib.tcl

FYI
I played around with opml a while back and it seemed very versatile.

It basically consists of an xml file of nested outline tags similiar to v-nodes
in leo xml. This then works with an xsl stylesheet that displays the outline
in a browser with scripted outline manipulation. (Uses div tags for this
display.)

What I discovered is that any html can make up the outline nodes , even forms,
etc. which collapse with the outline interaction. Just that the angle brackets
in the html must be escaped as is done within leo t nodes in .leo xml.

Actually, it would be interesting to see an addin that just passes leo nodes
to opml and then pops into the default browser. Also keep in mind that javascript
has an eval() statement that can be passed any script as a string. The leo text
box could be a form textarea box except that then there is no way to emulate
syntax coloring. Alternatively, this could be a floating window wrappiing node
text in html/body. (if nothing else, just destroy/close the window and reinitialize).
Maybe the images used in the opml could have javascript events like onclick()
to trigger refreshing leo text box from the t-nodes stored in an array or in
hidden form boxes.

Of course the effect of the stylesheet could be done via python script if no
xslt in the receiving browser. The minimal html and script might be just boilerplate
output.

You could mediate at bit of this with some initial set up dialogs.  Basically
a series of intro sreen of "Welcome to Leo"... Find operations can be used with
or without buttons in the log pane, while the key-only version is very useful,
new users may prefer the button version as they get to learn Leo, Would you
like me to activate the buttons?...Auto completions is a plugin that reduces
typing and helps  with tooltips to fill in the proper arguments to function
and method calls, would you like me...

Changed features with "use old style blah-blah setting" could be presented with
a "would you like use old style blah? checkbox.

It may not yet be time to worry about such "out of the box" experience enhancing
touches yet, but all this would be part of the "is Leo ready for Prime Time"

The following applies to Leo 4.3, which is in alpha as I write this. It describes
the LeoSetup routine that I submitted to Edward to solve the "can't find Python"
problem, and which Edward cleaned up for distribution.

I think a few further issues need attention. I noticed them while working on
the "can't find Python" problem, and deferred dealing with them. This appears
to me to be a good time to pick them up.

Before I start work on them, I would like to lay them out for your comment.
Are they pains in the first place? Are my proposals good enough, and do they
make sense?

Issue 1. LeoSetup still thinks Leo's user is an Administrator who owns the whole
machine.

For explanation, let's say that I log on as David to Windows 2000 or Windows
XP and install Leo 4.3. You then log out. You log in as Edward, and click Start,
pick Programs... you have no visible entry for Leo!

The current Setup routine allows no one but David to use Leo on this computer.
To make things worse, when I go to use Leo, I have to log in to Windows using
the account under which I installed it, which has Administrator rights to the
computer. In other words, I can't use Leo without operating the computer in
a mode that leaves it needlessly vulnerable to security violations.

Issue 2. LeoSetup allows only one copy of Leo on a given computer. 

LeoSetup assumes that you want Leo in C:\Program Files\Leo. The installer can
override that already. LeoSetup also goes to some trouble to set up the usual
click-to-open behavior for .leo files. That behavior is tied to the copy of
Python that was current when I ran LeoSetup, and tied to the copy of Leo that
was installed most recently.

Proposal: While LeoSetup should allow all accounts to share the Python code
for core Leo and its plug-ins, my guess is that we don't want to enforce that,
since Leo is a programmer's tool and the individual programmer will wish to
modify Leo and its pieces for the programmer's use.

Proposal Option 1. Setup should ask whether to install Leo for everyone or for
the installer's account only. If the answer to that question is "yes," Setup
should give the user a private copy of everything that comes with Leo -- the
only application shared should be the current Python, assuming that it is installed
for all users.

Python.org's installer for Python 2.4 allows the installed Python to work only
for the account that installed it. I found this in December and wrote code to
handle it, which I then commented out since the issue wasn't critical. I can
check a computer with a single-account installation of Python in order to figure
out how a single-account installation of Leo would have to handle the click-to-open
behavior.

Proposal Option 2. When LeoSetup finds Python installed for that single user,
it should ask whether to install Leo for the installer's account only. If the
answer to that question is "yes," Setup should give the user a private copy
of everything that comes with Leo and use the single-user installation of Python.
Why does this matter. If you need to test your plug-ins with different versions
of Python, this would make that easier.

Issue 3. LeoSetup always installs Python MegaWidgets ("Pmw"), even on computers
whose installed Python installation already includes it.

Proposal: put up a dialog box and ask whether Setup should install Pmw  I do
not know whether doing this is a good idea.

Issue 4. LeoSetup does not run without human intervention. This complicates
deploying Leo in multi-computer sites.

The message box that displays the path of the Python installation found is one
issue. I put it in to allow the installer to cross-check Setup's behavior. Since
nobody has complained about problems with the code I wrote to fix the problem
installing with Python 2.4 and Active Python, Setup need no longer force the
installer to review the message box's contents.

Proposal: The message box needs to time out after, say, 15 seconds. 

I last looked at the installer three months ago so I would have to look at the
rest of it for other barriers to automated installation.

Let me know what you think. I won't be able to start work for a week or so,
so there's no rush.

One way to make Leo more newbie friendly is to add menu items for key features
that are likely to cause confusion in the beginning.

Menu group 'minibuffer' can contain
show-mini-buffer
hide-mini-buffer
activate mini-buffer (Alt-X)
exit mini-buffer (Ctrl-G)
Help on mini-buffer

Group 'Settings' can contain
global LeoSettings.leo
local LeoSettings.leo (if does not exist, gives explanation)
Color Picker (show-colors)
Font Picker (show-fonts)

Spellcheck should be in the menu.

a7 feels faster than previous versions.

 inserting a new node   
2004-02-13 13:23  

 Hi,

When doing ctrl+i I on the node that has children I would prefer Leo to insert the new node as the last children instead of the first. It just makes more sense to me, for exemple when you take a big file and cut it in subnodes you typically start at the top and create new nodes while paging down the file.
What do you think ?
To try it just make this little change:
RCS file: /cvsroot/leo/leo/src/leoCommands.py,v

I'd like to see leo's @file can be extended to cover more protocols, like REBOL's "read" does. 

in short, it would be very sweet if the following work: 

@file http://www.somedomain.org/python/foo.py 

@file pass@ftp.sd.org/python/foo.py" target="_blank" target="_new">ftp://user:pass@ftp.sd.org/python/foo.py>

I will wait. Here's clarification, when you're ready for it:

All of my projects are stored on remote computers, and accessed via FTP. 
What I want is basically the ability to open up these projects directly 
through leo, instead of transferring the files manually between my computer 
and the computers that hold my projects, preferably through FTP.

My solution: A new menu item called 'FTP' or 'Remote'. Click on this, and an 
FTP dialog opens up, with an empty list of FTP sites, and the ability to add 
more. You select a site, and it brings up a list of files. You select a 
file, and it is added to your project. When you hit 'save', it automatically 
does an FTP send.

Python makes this a lot easier with the builtin module 'ftplib'. I'm sure 
there are similar things for C++. I hope you take this idea into 
consideration.

I often found myself using the same template for many projects but something differs in them. E.g. name of files. So my offer is add new directive variable:

@variable ProjectName MyFunProject

Later in parent node, child nodes or headers I could use this as:

$(ProjectNode).py or smth. similar.
This line when tangling could be replaces with
MyFunProject.py

Of course, there comes some complexity with untangling, but it is just an offer :)

I like this idea because I think templating is an important "design pattern"
that Leo could usefully support. Currently you can only do this in a limited
way by cloning nodes across derived files, which is something Edward doesn't
like to do because it makes reading derived files ambiguous (same information
in more than one place). I still do this because I rarely read files into Leo,
I mostly explicitely tangle files out of Leo.

Back to your idea ;) ISTM that your idea works well for directives (you can
do the variable substitution) but for general text (where I think there is a
bigger gain) there are two issues,

1. The template itself is now present in multiple derived files (see above)

2. The file derived from the template has now lost the variable name because
it was substituted out for the variable value

The end result is that templated files would almost certainly have to be a one
way street for Leo - they are derived from the Leo file but never read back
in. If you don't mind having this restriction, which basically means you have
to use @root nodes, then I don't see a problem.

Presumably most of this could all be done with a tangle_done script - the only
problem is how to change directives.

Just for your interests where is one way to create constants in leo (even multiline).
Let's way we have outline:

+-[ ] @file-nosent objects.mak
|   +-[clone] << my_const >>
+-[ ] @file-nosent makefile
    +-[close] << my_const >>

objects.mak is:
--
<< my_const >>.o:
gcc -g -c << my_const >>.c -o << my_const >>.o

<< my_const >>cmd.o:
gcc -g -c << my_const >>cmd.c -o << my_const >>cmd.o
--

makefile is
--
<< my_const >>:
gcc << my_const >>.o << my_const >>cmd.o -o << my_const >>
--

<< my_const >> can be:
test

While it works pretty good it still have some drawbacks:
1. You are forced to use @file-nosent. You can edit your files outside of Leo.
2. You can't use << my_const >> in header lines, while it would be really nice
if you could write
@file-nosent obj_<< my_const >>.mak
(Leo lacks introspection?)
3. Result is not 100% what you expect.

---

(constant = variable = define) ???

Constants and clones in fact are the same. Usually clones are used like symbolic
links (or shortcuts) not like clones or constants. I think this could be
separated.

Constants could be read back into leo. E.g.: you have constant value in leo
file and while reading back files to outline you change all values with constant
name.

I hope I am clear :)

I think I understand what Samir is getting at. 

In PythonWin, or other IDE's for other languages, you are able to execute the
"current program" in a way that it will behave identically to if it had been
run from the command line.

For Python this requires,

1. That the script run with __name__ == "__main__", so that the standard "if
__name__ ..." section will be executed properly.

2. You are able to pass command line parameters to the script. In some IDE's
you are able to set default command line parameters and these are "injected"
into the sys.argv (or equivalent) so that, as far as the program is concerned,
it looks like you ran it from the command line with some aruments.

The underlying assumption is that you want to run an entire program from Leo,
not just a script. I would find this very useful also as I could run unit tests
or even my entire apps by just hitting, for exampe, F5.

P.S. I think a feature that could make Leo *the* IDE for developing in 
interpreted languages is something like the (X)Emacs comint-mode.el for 
interacting with the shell and interpreters.

comint-mode.el serves as the basis for interactive modes for a number of
languages--OCaml, Haskell, SML, among them. It allows for editing expressions in
one buffer and triggering their evaluation in another buffer that has an
interpreter running in it, along with entering commands in the interpreter
buffer and moving back and forth through the history of their evaluation.

Imagine being able to highlight a node in Leo, and have all the code in it and
its children evaluated in an interpreter running in a separate window or pane,
much as Leo can open a Python shell now. Users of those languages could build
plug-ins specific to their language atop that layer, and the @language directive
could activate that. I think that would be very cool.

> I really do want and need to be able to embed basic links throughout out my Leo outlines in a natural 2005 fashion. 

This should be fairly easy to do.

At present, the use_hyperlinks configuration option controls whether Leo generates 'live' hyperlinks for section names.  I don't enable this be default because I dislike jumping around the outline.  Instead, I use clones.

The code to do these kinds of hyperlinks is pretty straightforward.  There is a little code in the colorizer and callbacks in the leoTkinterTree, iirc.

Supporting hyperlinks to urls would be similar.  They could appear in the following situations:

- Anywhere where @language plain is in effect.
- In comments where @language (a programming language) is in effect.
- Anywhere (except in comments?) where @language html is in effect.

This would make a straightforward plugin.  Mind you, this should be in Leo's core, but a plugin would get my attention :-)  Perhaps the reason I haven't done this is that I keep thinking a generalized syntax colorer is near ;-)

I'll be happy to run some test and report to you. But  I suspect from your post
a slight misunderstanding about Alt+Tab.

Alt+Tab just toggles the active window.
It works fine with Leo on Windows wherver I have tried it.

Resizing wondows via hotkeys is another matter.
The special "Windows" Key + m will minimize all windows. 

But unfortunately I've not yet discovered any opposite shortcut to  maximize
all windows :-(
I've tried various 3rd party hotkey utililties, but somehow always end up dropping
them.

<rant>
I really hate wasting any time dragging windows around and resizing them or
clicking to bring them into top focus. As I work mainly with graphics, and mult-task
intesenlty bwetn apps,  it is especially important to reduce visual clutter
on screen.

For many years the way to do this has been combining maximized [or minimized]
windows with  Alt+Tab. Alt+Tab  lets one jump rapidly betwen open apps and windows
without ever need to repostion or resize them.

As a consultant, its one of the first things I ever teach clients. Often it
transforms their perception of using Windows.

It is so painful to watch people dragging and rescaling  windows all over the
place. Ironically, I've witnessed some very smart programmers fly through vi
or emacs but then slow to tortoises when navigation mice and windows. I beleive
as long as we have the curertn wnidows UI paradigm,  use of Alt+Tab is an essential
part of  GUI 'litteracy' - an essentail skill all shoudl have. Alas its still
little known or discussed.

There is also a nice toggle feature so one can jump back to the last app/window
as its first "stop". Typically one is working between two apps for some specific
task, even though many are open.

Keeping one's finger on the 'Alt' key then tapping 'Tab' lets one hop along
the list.

Adding 'shift' to the mix helps one to go in reverse. 

Above all one can keep one hand on the mouse, the other on the keyboard [ALt+Tab]
and ones mind/eye on teh screen. For me it means left hand "plays" the bass
pattern using Alt+Tab along with the clipboard shortcuts [CTRL+ z,x,c,v] ,while
right hand on the mouse mouse  provides the melody.

I've been using variations on the above since 1987 when I bought an Amiga2000.
I seem to recall SGI had one also. And after learning about Alt+Tab on windows,
I  found a utility to work the same way on Macintosh.  I am very happy to discover
that MacOSX now has built-in ALt+Tab :-)
</rant>

Meanwhile, Iam  still wondering how to set Leo [3.12 beta 1, Python 2.2.2, Tk
8.3.2] default to a maxmimized or minimized window size by itself.

And also to remember the last size/position it had. I vaguely remember that
it used to do that, but perhaps I am mistaking it for some other software ?

thanks

 Scrolling and the Tree Frame in Linux   
2003-10-20 12:13  

I'm using tk-8.4.3, python-2.2.3 on linux. The MouseWheel events do not work for me in the Tree Frame.

I added <Button-4> and <Button-5> bindings similar to the existing <MouseWheel> binding in LeoFrame.finishCreate(), associating them with two methods, LeoFrame.OnMouseScrollDown and LeoFrame.OnMouseScrollUp that took the appropriate parts of OnMouseWheel()

Now it works, sort-of. It scrolls properly unless the cursor is an I-Bar, e.g., over text. But at least this removes in-part the most glaring UI problem for me with Leo in tk. I suppose I am spoiled with the mouse wheel and want it to work everywhere.

Thanks for the great program.

Ctrl-x, expecting to cut my selection, but the entire node is cut.

   I know there's a problem with tk and the shift key status, so I'm wondering
if it would be possible to change the shape of the cursor when the Caps-Lock
is ON (preferrably a big red flashing blot 8-), or otherwise show that Caps-Lock
is active ( "CAPS" on a status line, for instance).

  Another way: I don't know if this goes against an "anti-modalism rule," but
only allowing Ctrl-Shift-x|c|v in the outline pane would also be acceptable
to me.

A better design for user icons

Using tuples in t.unknownAttributes["icons"] is too constricted.  Much better
to have t.unknownAttributes["icons"] be a list of g.Bunches rather
than a list of tuples.  Each of these bunches could have the
following keys:

"type"

"file", "icon" or "url".  At present my prototype code uses "file" to specify
the location of an icon.

"where":

"beforeBox", "beforeIcon", "beforeHeadLine", "afterHeadline".  This specifies
where to put the icon.  The default would be "beforeHeadline".  "beforeBox"
means before the plus/minus box.  "beforeIcon" means before the standard icon.

"height":

the height of the icon to use when calculating the line height.  Default: get
from the icon itself, if possible.

"width":

the width of the icon to use when calculating where to put the following element.
Default: get from the icon, if possible.

"xoffset"

Leo draws the icon at x + xoffset, where x is determined by the where param
above.  Default 0.

"xpad"

The amount of extra space following the icon.  Default 0.

"yoffset"

Leo draws the icon at y + yoffset.  Default 0.

"ypad"

The amount of extra vertical space to add to the line height.  Default 0.

These offset and pad values are integer pixel values and may be positive or
negative.

"lineHeight"  NOT USED.

Overrides any calculated line height.  Default:  lineHeight = yoffset + height + ypad.

"onClick", "onRightClick", "onDoubleClick"

commands to call when the specified event happens.  By default, the "onRightClick"
icon will be bound to a popup menu that offers the user a chance to delete the
icon,  and maybe other options such as "nudging" the icon up or down, left or
right.

"popUpMenu"

a list of items to put in a popup menu.  This would be a convenience to avoid
having to use "onRightClick".

I think you get the idea.  We want the drawing code to support lots of common
things that plugins would like to do.  I'll probably think of other goodies,
but this already is a big step forward.  Note that each of these keys will have
a default, so plugins only need to specify keys that have non-default values.

Edward

P.S.  Other gui's might not be able to support all these options.  That's ok.
The drawing code in gui plugins should degrade gracefully.

"lineHeight"

An integer y offset for the entire line (except user icons, which are flexible enough).  You can use this to center the following vertically: the plus/minus box, the horizontal line to the plus/minus box, the standard headline box, and the Tk.Text widget for the headline.

Between the two of them there should be enough information to help you achieve what you want. 
 
It is possible to do pretty much anything you want but you will have to provide the infrastructure yourself because Leo doesn't natively support it.

Open Discussion
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=2016634
By: jasonic

I have been thinking about LeoZopeWiki integration. I am a recovering Zope addict
[1999-2001] :-)  I believe Zope offers a very valuable client and server for
Leo.

I think Ed higlighted the distinction of collboration vs. sharing. So consdering
that re:  Leo and CVS , Leo and Zope, Leo and wikis, I had another idea this
morning..

LEO+JABBER

Jabber is an open XML-based  instant messaging and *presence* system. Although
Jabber is typically used for IM chat, its core designers have a much bigger
vision in mind.

Jabber Software Foundation
http://www.jabber.org/
O'Reilly Book
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jabber/
Python Jabber library
http://jabberpy.sourceforge.net/

CVS etc all depend on runing diff on posted static files which are checked in
or out. Clearly valuable, and good for __sharing__ but not so suitable as the
communication paradigm needed for collboration.

Wikis and Zope all suffer from problem of versioning and the time delay and
lack of timely communications to their cobtributors. There is no 'shared state'
or persistence in the collaboration beyond their own files or objectdatabases.

For example if two people want to edit a wiki or Zope site, they have an imeedaiet
problem of knowing whether or not the someone else is working one it already.

Score:
Sharing 1
Collaboration 0

Two  or more people wanting to edit a common project based on Leo have the same
dilemma. They can check the leo file into a wiki, Zope or CVS, but they still
don't have direct communication at teh content level.

score:
Sharing 1
Collaboration 0

PROPOSAL: LeoJabber
1. Integrate a Jabber client into Leo 
2. Add special Leo module to jabberd [Jabber's server daemon]

Leo-based developers could work in direct communication with each other allowing
them to add, edit and comment nodes in a shared le-space, local or remote. Static
publishing via upload/import etc all still apply.

LeoJabber would mean subscribing developers could immediately be aware of changes
and then apply whatever strategy is appropriate for handling them, such as:
 
a. autoUpdate()
b. makeNewNode()
c. runDiffFunctions()
d. notifyPartners()
e. notifyPublic()
etc..

Jabber via its presencing mechanism offers real-time and just-in time communcations.
If you are logged out, then mesages are queued.

An open Jabber message session is actually one long piece of XML data passed
over an XMLSocket :-) Sounds like a great fit for Leo

- All Jabber configs are XML.
- Good smart open source community.
- Similar open embracing philsophy as Leo
- Jabber connects diverse messaging systems., MSN, AOL etc [Most are
close/proprietary, though the trend is toward greater openness and connectivity]
- Many Jabber clients already. There is even one written in Flash so that any
webpage can participate.

Embedding Jabber in Leo would allow 'discussion' threads to  be integrated.
Developers need to bounce idea and notes around just as this forum does. But
often they need to be more provate or more focused on project specifics.
WORKFLOW 
It is important to know  which code is uptodate, but arguably, even *more* important
is to know which people and what discussions are uptodate. And if not, what
their status is. The larger, longer the more global the develpoment office/project,
the more this is true.

IM [instant messaging] are popular largely becuae they offer direct communication
with status feedback to crucial people's workflow:
"off-line", "on-line", "back-soon", "later" etc

Jabber extends this idea to create a platform for any presence application.
That is its long term-goal.

So in a Leo deevlopment project, that presence might apply to adding status
mesages such as
"making changes" "new version" "debugging" "review only" "major re-write"

or perhaps status/presence woudl be used for much lower level Leo-specific
purposes.

"new node"
"cloned to .."
"@file imported"
"version uploaded"
etc

I am not suggesting that Leo forget CVS or file upload storage. But I think
Jabber may truly provide the Missing Link, literally for Leo collaboration.

 RE: Leo over the network   
2003-05-10 00:06  
So this is my first proposal: 

Requirements 
-------------------- 

* Read remote outlines. 
** With Leo clients. 
** Over the web. 

* Edit remote outlines. 

* Import remote outlines (retrieve outlines from the web). 

* Synchronize local outlines with remote ones (web to local and local to web). 

* Publish outlines (send outlines to the web). 

* The Leo client have to be keept lighweigth. 

* The Leo remote outline access server should be a lighweigth daemon. 

* This daemon should automagically render HTML from the outlines. 

* The outlines should be editable from the web and via Leo client. 

* Concurency management is must. 

* The remote servers should be included in the leo client as leo nodes (just like leo files, but remotes). 
"@leo-outline leo.server.org:854" 

* By this way I could have access to local server nodes. 
"@leo-outline localhost:854" 

* The remote server should offer one and only one big outline with sub nodes, and so on, and so on... 

* At least the concurency should be managed as "when someone write, all the other ones only can read" 

* It is better if Leo devellop simultaneaously some hypertext/wiki extensions. 

---------------------------- 
End of requeriments 

This requeriments requires a client-server architecture, with basic commands as: 
- Update node 
- Lock/release node 
- Edit outline 
- Download outline 
- Upload outline 

well that is by the moment, I hope that we will be able to create a Finite, clear, requeriments list for this branch of Leo.

Currently clicking on the minibuffer and typing text has no effect.  Kinda confusing

@nocolor

- Apparently, the colorizer _already_ uses Python indices!

- colorizer.tag calls colorizer.index to do all conversion, so it is completely index-neutral.

- The edit body routines _already_ use Python indices!
    - c.getBodyLines calls:
        - body.getSelectionLines
        - body.getAllText
        - body.getYScrollPosition
        - body.getTextSelection
    - c.updateBodyPane calls:
        - body.setSelectionAreas
        - body.setYScrollPosition
        - body.makeInsertPointVisible

    That is, these routines never _use_ Tk indices,
    although they may pass them to and from body methods.

Find code:
    - The leoFind methods use the Tk wrappers to insulate the code from the Tk indices.
    - leoFind.search calls gui_search, which is a thin wrapper around the Tk find search.
        - This is a major simplification of the code, but it would have to be rewritten
          to make the code really portable.
        - In other words, we would use string.find or re.find instead of tk.find.
            - The code can use Python indices, then convert to body(gui) indices
            pretty much like the colorizer does:

@color
def index (self,i):
    return self.body.convertRowColumnToIndex(self.line_index,i)
@nocolor

        - The only difference is that we might have to compute the row and column indices
          from the Python index, but that is easy!

- This might fix some binding problems on some platforms.

- Might want to define <<localUndo>> for undo in Find Panel.

I found this link:
http://www.8ung.at/klappnase/TkinterDnD/TkinterDnD.html
TkinterDnD

so if Edward is interested in adding drag and drop support for regular leo,
this might be a path to do so.  It looks like an active project.

This is done automatically now!  I may have to use configure events.

> When I have the 'split mode' set to display tree and log on left, and viewpane
on right, I sometimes need to increase the width of the window.

When I do the resize, the tree/log panes grow in proportion. I don't know about
others, but I'd much prefer if the tree/log panes stayed at the same width,
and only the view pane grew.

To enable incremental allocation of Tk widgets during redraws, set self.allocateOnlyVisibleNodes = True in tree.__init__.

To do:
	
- We might switch to a line-oriented scheme.
	- This might simplify the code and make the code more useful to users.
	- Conceivably this scheme might eliminate the need for the auto-scroll in the redraw code,
	and that might make a single-pass redraw scheme possible.

- The last line isn't always completely visible: this is clearly a bug.

These routines change self to a new position "in place".
That is, these methods must _never_ call p.copy().

When moving to a nonexistent position, these routines simply set p.v = None,
leaving the p.stack unchanged. This allows the caller to "undo" the effect of
the invalid move by simply restoring the previous value of p.v.

These routines all return self on exit so the following kind of code will work:

@ This is not going well :-(  Probably what is happening is that Tk is competing with the win32 extensions in setting the clipboard.  It might not be so easy to

a) completely disable Tk's clipboard handling, in _both_ headlines and body text.
b) do the cut/paste operations "by hand".

This might require new body routlines to replace the selected text in the body.  And then there are issues relating to whether the headline or body text should be changed.  All in all, this is much harder than it looks.

Also, if one is not careful one can take fatal Python errors related to missing threads.  Pretty much a nightmare.

By: ksejlod ( Peter Barrel ) 
 I Have a (maybe) great idea!   
2004-02-15 04:29

I've been using LEO for a while and finding surprinsingly powerfull new uses now and then, (hey, not a week passes that i dont think to myself : "why did'nt anyone thought of that kind of tool that is LEO. It's so stupid to program such a tool, yet no one thought of doing such a thing ! ")

I was wondering if there was a leo keyword (beginning with "@") that would do a feature I thought would be great: something such as :
@h
@endh
and of course, similarily...
@f
@endf

Standing for "Header", "End Header", "Footer" and "End Footer". Let me please explain ...

When creating files with @file (or nosentinels) I use the keyword "@others" in the starting node body of the file and place in the file, as it's decendants (children, grand-children & so on) some clones of other stuff somewhere else outside of this file (usualy, clones of parts of program regrouped as children of a "components" node up in the leo outline. Typical Example:

-Introduction
-+components
-a
-b
-c
-+@file program.BAS
-b
-c
-a

a, b, and c are clones and the @file node contains @others.

As you see, I proceed that way because in older programming languages or in lower level languages, the order of components such as procs, declarations, etc as an importance. It also has the implication that << and >> brackets are irrelevant in my way of using leo.

Now, my feature that I looked for in the doc but could not find (so i suggest it here in case no one had any need of this before) is that when used in the BODY of a node part of an "@file" the @h and @endh would define a chunk of text in the body, you've guessed it, to be added before _each_ children node and ONLY children no grandchildren or any deeper. But It could also be used INSIDE the body of a children to define headers or footers for IT'S OWN direct children.

so, eehh, do you see the relevance of such a feature? Have i explained it clearly? maybe this would help:
CONST baba=2 AS INTEGER
CONST bebe=7 AS INTEGER
CONST zaza=5 AS INTEGER
CONST bobo=1 AS INTEGER
... the beginning and end of each of those "parts-of-a-program" is the same for a potential lot of lines... 

To Be Precise :
It's just really for adding something at end or beginning of a direct children of a node part of an @file in the tangling process. 

Is this feature already implemented but i have not found it? I'm pretty sure it easy to implement... what do you people think of this?
Thanks 
--
k

p.s. I'm the guy who proposed that in the untangling process, a clone would not be updated by it's _Last-Instance-Found_ in the @file beeing untangled, but instead updated by the _Last-Modified-One-Found_ in the @file... :)

(ooouuuuhh that would be slick...)

@nocolor

Under X Window system, when text is selected, it is automatically entered into a buffer and can be pasted with the middle button of the mouse.

In Leo, when this is done, the text is rendered in right place, but it doesn't stick unless some key is pressed after pasting. That is, if I leave the node in question without pressing any key after pressing the middle button, the pasted text is gone when I come back to that node.

Doing copy and paste works normally when done through the edit menu.

 Pasted text doesn't stick   
2002-11-01 13:38  
System: Linux 

Under X Window system, when text is selected, it is automatically entered into a buffer and can be pasted with the middle button of the mouse. 

In Leo, when this is done, the text is rendered in right place, but it doesn't stick unless some key is pressed after pasting. That is, if I leave the node in question without pressing any key after pressing the middle button, the pasted text is gone when I come back to that node. 

Doing copy and paste works normally when done through the edit menu. 

-------------------

I also found out that if you do an extra "click" on the control key, it will
stick from then on.

If your text should have color in it, you can see that right before you "click",
the text has no color and the color back on right after you click the control.

It maybe a clue to someone, but seems strange to me.

@nocolor

Bumping the thread because the bug still persists. 

I've also noticed that the automatic select'n'paste doesn't work between nodes. That is, I can select text and paste a copy of it in the same node with middle button, but if I change click to another node, the paste buffer is erased. The automatic pasting works between Leo and other applications, however, and I can paste between nodes if I copy the selection to buffer by CTR-C. 

Maybe this is related to the non-sticking bug?

This may be a Linux-only bug related to the control-v workaround.

Hi again,

Leo has IMHO a slight inconsistency as when a new node is created and has to
be given a name.

When the new node is created, the string "NewHeadline" appears and is selected.
Then there are 2 ways of setting a new name:

1. by typing the new name character by character using the keyboard. This way,
"NewHeadline" disappears as the first character of the new name is typed. Here
the implicit idea is that "NewHeadline" is very unlikely to be the final node
name -- which makes sense to me ;-)

2. by pasting the contents of the clipboard, with Ctrl-v. This way, "NewHeadline"
*remains* and the contents of the clipboard is appended to it.


I find leo's behaviour in case #2 inconsistent with #1 and suggest that the
first approach should be preferred.

Cheers,
Nicolas

When in 'vertical split' mode (with viewpane on right, and tree pane over log pane on left), the horixontal scrollbar at bottom of screen is at full width, despite the fact that not all of the tree pane area is displayed. 

Another way of saying this - I narrow the tree and log panes, to the extent that the display of tree node headings is truncated. But the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom doesn't contract, and doesn't allow me to horizontally scroll the tree pane to expose the rest of the node headings.

RE: Leo freezing up  
2004-12-01 06:15

The freezing problem on debian sid (which is also my current OS) is caused by a bug in Tkinter: Tkinter does not work when libtk is compiled with thread support, which is the case on debian sid for tk8.4 
I compiled my own non-threaded libtk with the corresponding python/tkinter, and the freeze magically vanished.  
 
This is a known bug in debian bugtrack:

#@+node:ekr.20031218072017.674:Caps lock affects keyboard shortcuts on Windows
Using leo under Windows, the keyboard shortcuts seem to use the "Caps Lock" state in determining the shift state when executing a shortcut.   For example, if the caps-lock key is on, then Ctrl-X is interpreted as Shift-Ctrl-X and cuts a node rather than selected text, and Shift-Ctrl-X is interpreted as Ctrl-X and cuts text.

#@+node:ekr.20031218072017.675:Tree problems
1. The border of the tree control is gray, and it is overwritten with large headlines.  This may be a Tk or Tkinter bug.

2. Adding trailing whitespace to a line in body text does not set the file-dirty mark.  This can never cause a derived file to become "out-of-synch" because the read code does not compare body text.

Apparently there is no way to fix this glitch because of holes in Tk's event mechanism.  Specifically, tree.idle_body_key has no way to tell directly what keystroke caused it to be entered.

 RE: BUG: Non-leading tabs not working properl

 This seems to be a TK bug. I've reproduced the problem directly in Tk.

It's been around for a long time :-(

More details on this page, along with a patch for an earlier version.

http://www.qs.co.nz/Tcl/TkTabs.html

The Tk folks fixed a bug I reported with Ctrl-V behavior, but it took about a year for them to get to it. I don't have high expectations with this problem either, but I'll probably put together a patch for some of the recent version of Tk and submit the patches and bug report.

I've submitted a patch and bug report to the Tk project.

The patch, #879073, for those that want to fix this problem on their systems,
is at:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=879073&group_id=12997&atid=31299

And the bug report, #879077, is at:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=879077&group_id=12997&atid=11299
7

The patch is for 8.4.2.  If you have a different version, you can probably figure
out the changes needed by looking at the patch file.  If not, let me know your
version and I may be able to produce a patch for it.

Note: If you use tabs for anything other than leading whitespace, you will find
this patch really helpful.  I make lots of little tables when I'm documenting
or note-taking ... this fix really helped my sanity when making those tables
inside Leo.

Leo 4.1 rc3, build 1.62 , December 19, 2003
Python 2.3.0, Tk 8.4.2
Linux 2.4.22-21mdkenterprise

1. Any tab typed before the first tab stop behaves correctly (the cursor is moved to the tab stop). Good.

2. Any tab typed after a non-tab character (even a space) _and_ after the first tab stop position doesn't behave like a tab and doesn't move the cursor to the next tab stop. Bad.

3. Any tab typed after a tab character will behave properly no matter what position on the line. Okay.

To reproduce this, set your global tab prefernence to 4. Show invisibles. And then create a node containing:

[BEGIN BODY TEXT]
@language plain
@tabwidth 8
[END BODY TEXT]

Create a child node to that one, containing:

[BEGIN BODY TEXT]
@root-code somefilename
\t\tThis works
bbb\tAnd This works
So\tdoes this

But, this \tdoes not.
Here is the two-tab \t\t behavior.
[END BODY TEXT]

I hope this is a Leo bug and not a Tk bug.

This document demonstrates what appears to be a bug in Leo 4.1 rc3, build 1.62 of December 19, 2003.

It has manifested when Leo is executed under Python 2.3.3, Tk 8.4.3 under Windows 2000.

In brief, derived XML files are not well-formed with respect to comments under some conditions.  Comments can wind up nested, which looks okay to humans but not to XML parsers.

By: thyrsus

There is a lot of correct intepretation going on, but there are some errors.
As an example, the anaconda code, in text.py, contains the following lines.
I'll use periods for leading whitespace, the two characters ^I for leading tabs,
and a $ to indicate a newline:

class WaitWindow:
def pop(self):
    self.screen.popWindow()
    self.screen.refresh()

def __init__(self, screen, title, text):
    self.screen = screen
    width = 40
    if (len(text) < width): width = len(text)

    t = TextboxReflowed(width, text)

    g = GridForm(self.screen, title, 1, 1)
    g.add(t, 0, 0)
    g.draw()
    self.screen.refresh()


After importing file text.py, I get three associated nodes like so:

[class WaitWindow]
.|
.+-[pop]
.|
.+-[__init__]

However, the contents of the nodes are off.  In node [class WaitWindow] the
text is

class WaitWindow:
@others
    self.screen = screen
    width = 40
    if (len(text) < width): width = len(text)

    t = TextboxReflowed(width, text)
    g = GridForm(self.screen, title, 1, 1)
    g.add(t, 0, 0)
    g.draw()
    self.screen.refresh()

Node [pop] contains the text

def pop(self):

Node [__init__] contains the text

self.screen.popWindow()
self.screen.refresh()

def __init__(self, screen, title, text):

This anaconda code is being correctly interpreted by the python 1.5 interpreter.
I'm too green with python to pronounce on whether the formatting is conventional.
I don't consider this a bug a major problem, but it should probably be addressed
before we start touting Leo for large collections of existing code.

This is my first experience importing python; in the past I've imported perl
code, and Leo gave me just one big @file node, and I was on my own to better
structure it.  Given the perversity of perl syntax ("Nothing but perl can parse
Perl." - Tom Christiansen), that's probably the right thing to do.  It's a judgement
call for whomever wants to take responsibility for the python importer as to
whether that may be the right thing to do for python.

sometimes after a drag of a node, 
then the expand/contract doesnt work.
click or menu has no effect.
in an open leo
maybe it is ok after you save the file
other times only fix is to exit & restart.
