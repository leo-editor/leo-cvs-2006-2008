gtkGui:

** Rewrite leoKeyEventClass.
   This should be done by EKR: it is an essential part of all key handline.
- There is no root ivar in the gtk gui.  Rewrite all code that uses self.root.
- Rewrite runOpenFileDialog
- Rewrite runSaveFileDialog

gtkFrame:
- What is the correct way to close a window?
- Should there be a separate minibuffer class?
- Should there be separate files for the log, body, etc.?
- Should there be smaller methods to create components and make bindings?

gtkFind:
- Create the find tab.

gtkComparePanel:
- At present this does not exist.  The compare window is optional.

General:
- Write unit tests for all new gui code.
- Unit tests for showFindPanel and openCompareWindow.
