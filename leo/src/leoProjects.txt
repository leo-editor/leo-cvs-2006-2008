# This part of the tree shows views of the outline related to specific 
# projects or tasks.  I put such headlines in parentheses, and that is just my 
# convention.
# 
# I create a new view by cloning headlines that relate to its task, and moving 
# the cloned headlines under the task headline.  This greatly increases my 
# focus.  Any changes made in a task view to clone headlines affect the other 
# clones scattered throughout the outline.  In particular, all @file nodes 
# containing changed clones become marked as dirty, so they will be written 
# when the entire outline is saved.
